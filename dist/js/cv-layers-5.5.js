The MODIS instrument is on board NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. The orbit of the Terra satellite goes from north to south across the equator in the morning and Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon resulting in global coverage every 1 to 2 days. The EOS satellites have a ±55 degree scanning pattern and orbit at 705 km with a 2,330 km swath width.<br><br>It takes approximately 2 – 4 hours after satellite overpass for MODIS Rapid Response to process the data, and for the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to update the website. Occasionally, hardware errors mean that it takes longer the 2-4 hours to process the data. Additional information on the MODIS system status can be found at MODIS Rapid Response. ",

The purpose of this experimental product is to provide mariners and others with enhanced &ldquo;awareness of developing and transitory thunderstorm activity, to give users the ability to determine whether a cloud system is producing lightning and if that activity is increasing or decreasing...&rdquo; Lightning Strike Density, as opposed to display of individual strikes, highlights the location of lightning cores and trends of increasing and decreasing activity. The maps depict the density of lightning strikes during a 15 minute time period at an 8 km x 8 km spatial resolution. The lightning strike density maps cover the geographic area from 25 degrees South to 80 degrees North latitude and from 110 degrees East to 0 degrees West longitude. The map units are number of strikes per square km per minute multiplied by a scaling factor of 10^3. The strike density is color coded using a color scheme which allows the data to be easily seen when overlaid on GOES imagery and to distinguish values at low density values. The maps are updated on nowCOAST approximately every 15 minutes. The latest data depicted on the maps are approximately 12 minutes old (or older). The OPC lightning strike density product is still experimental and may not always be available. Given the spatial resolution and latency of the data, the data should NOT be used to activite your lightning safety plans. Always follow the safety rule: when you first hear thunder or see lightning in your area, activate your emergency plan. If outdoors, immediately seek shelter in a substantial building or a fully enclosed metal vehicle such as a car, truck or a van. Do not resume activities until 30 minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder.",

Some METARs are encoded by automated airport weather stations located at airports, military bases, and other sites. Some locations still use augmented observations, which are recorded by digital sensors, encoded via software, and then reviewed by certified weather observers or forecasters prior to being transmitted. Observations may also be taken by trained observers or forecasters who manually observe and encode their observations prior to transmission.",

The station model is method for representing information collected at an observing station using symbols and numbers. The station model depicts current weather conditions, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction, visibility, air temperature, dew point temperature, sea surface water temperature, significant wave height, air pressure adjusted to mean sea level, and the change in air pressure over the last 3 hours. The circle in the model is centered over the latitude and longitude coordinates of the station. The total cloud cover is expressed as a fraction of cloud covering the sky and is indicated by the amount of circle filled in. (Cloud cover is not presently displayed due to a problem with the source data. Present weather information is also not available for display at this time.) Wind speed and direction are represented by a wind barb whose line extends from the cover cloud circle towards the direction from which the wind is blowing. The short lines or flags coming off the end of the long line are called barbs. The barb indicates the wind speed in knots. Each normal barb represents 10 knots, while short barbs indicate 5 knots. A flag represents 50 knots. If there is no wind barb depicted, an outer circle around the cloud cover symbol indicates calm winds. The map of observations are updated in the nowCOAST map service approximately every 10 minutes. However, since the reporting frequency varies by network or station, the observation at a particular station may have not updated and may not update until after the next hour.",

They are co-located with UHF ground-air-ground (G/A/G) transmitter/receiver (GATR) facilities at many locations. Fourteen sites have VHF radios as well. The GATR facility provides radio access to fighters and Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft from the SOCCs. The JSS has been enhanced under the FAA/Air Force Radar Replacement Program with 44 ARSR-4/FPS-130 radars to replace some of the many previous long-range radars. This provides common, high-performance, unattended radars. The ARSR-4/FPS-130 is a 3-D long range radar with an effective detection range of some 250 miles and has been fully integrated with JSS at all joint use sites.<br /><br />These radars are generally unattended except for periodic FAA maintenance crews which visit the sites as necessary.<br>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Surveillance_System">Joint Surveillance System Wikipedia</a><br><a href="https://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/airdef/arsr-4.htm">ARSR-4 Reference FAS.org</a></p>',

Currents in the ocean are equivalent to winds in the atmosphere because they move things from one location to another. These currents carry nutrients as well as pollutants, so it is important to know the currents for ecological and economic reasons. The currents carry any floating object, which is why U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue operators use HF radar data to make critical decisions when rescuing disabled vessels and people stranded in the water.</p><p>These radars can measure currents over a large region of the coastal ocean, from a few kilometers offshore up to 200 km, and can operate under any weather conditions. They are located near the water’s edge, and need not be situated atop a high point of land.  Traditionally, crews placed current measuring devices directly into the water to retrieve current speeds.  While these direct measurement systems are still widely used as a standard reference, HF radars are the only sensors that can measure large areas at once with the detail required for the important applications described here.  Not even satellites have this capability.</p>',

The irradiances at the Earth's surface are especially important in understanding the climate processes, since the Earth's surface transforms approximately 60% of the solar radiation absorbed by the planet. These irradiances also occupy an important position in the ocean surface energy budget, ultimately influencing the major features of ocean currents.</p><p>While a small change in irradiance at the Earth's surface may cause a profound change in climate, the existing radiometric network is not capable of arriving at the required accuracy for climate research. In fact our present understanding of the radiation distribution both - horizontally and vertically - is not sufficient to understand the present climate. The simulation of the past and future climate changes, which would be induced by the change in radiation, is even more uncertain.</p><p>This was the background for the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Radiative Fluxes Working Group to initiate a new Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) to support the research projects of the WCRP and other scientific programs. Some years later the BSRN incorporated into the WCRP Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel.</p>",
