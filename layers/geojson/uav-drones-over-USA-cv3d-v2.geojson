COA for 2011-ESA-4: Due to the nature of its intended use the Miami-Dade Police Department is requesting the ability to utilize the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) up to and including 300' AGL in .  This would enable the MAV to show an aerial view of most residences from overhead.  It would enable the on scene tactical commander to view all four sides of a structure in real time and allow him to make decisions based on this information.  This would increase his situational awareness and safety to officers while reducing radio transmissions.  This altitude would also avoid any potential conflicts by providing a level of separation between the MAV and other Air Traffic. The pilot and/or Observer are to maintain line of sight contact and visual observation of the MAV while in flight and remain within 2000 feet laterally of the MAV.  The request for this increased distance is that the MAV Program was intended in situations where a subject was either known or suspected to be in possession of a long gun where utilization of traditional aviation assets would pose an increased risk to the aircrew and aircraft.  This distance is easily achievable by a skilled gunman with a rifle and/or a scope but would give the aircrew additional flexibility in site selection.

The Government also purchased a perpetual restrictive easement in approximately 125,000 acres of land, commonly referred to as the “buffer zone,” surrounding the test facility and extending about six miles in all directions. Although most of the buffer zone is privately owned, the area is uninhabited because the Government’s easement prohibits habitable structures, including mobile homes, campers, trailers or other enclosed structures. However, the easement does not prohibit landowners from using lands within the buffer zone for activities that do not violate the easement restriction, such as timber production, grazing, haying, agriculture, fishing ponds, mineral extraction, and recreational activities.
