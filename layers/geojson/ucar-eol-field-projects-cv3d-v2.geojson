The spectrum of significant MCSs is approximately bracketed by bow-echoes at small scales, which can be responsible for generating large swaths of damaging surface winds, and mesoscale convective complexes with mesoscale convective vortices (MCVs) at larger scales, which can produce widespread heavy rainfall and flash flooding. Both are examples of convective systems that develop appreciable vertical components of vorticity and often are seen to evolve into comma shaped precipitation regions. Understanding how MCSs organize, propagate and regenerate has important implications for understanding the transport and cycling of water on regional (1000 km) scales. <\/p><ul><li><b>Dates ::<\/b> 20 May - 6 July, 2003<\/li><li><b>Location ::<\/b> Mascoutah, Illinois<\/li><li><b>Facility ::<\/b> U.S. Naval Research Laboratory P-3 Aircraft<\/li><\/ul><p align=\"center\">http:\/\/www.eol.ucar.edu\/dir_off\/projects\/2003\/BAMEX.html<\/p>"

The location of the CASES site is the upper Walnut River watershed north of Winfield, Kansas which is within Department of Energy's well instrumented ARM\/CART research area. Here, boundary layer profilers will be deployed coincident with the natural boundaries of the watershed. Such positioning simplifies efforts to close the surface water balance since the net runoff can be measured at one point. This, in turn, also helped to verify other atmosphere\/surface linkages. Surface flux and radiation data obtained within the watershed, in conjunction with WSR-88D radars, satellite data, stream gages, soil moisture data, topographic and land use data, surface meteorological data, biophysical data, and atmospheric-hydrologic-ecologic models, will allow for detailed descriptions of surface-atmosphere linkages and exchange processes between the watershed and the atmosphere.<\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www.eol.ucar.edu\/projects\/cases\/cases.html#Cases<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>22 April - 22 May, 1997<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Walnut Watershed, Kansas<\/li><li><b>EOL Facility :: <\/b>Integrated Sounding System (ISS)<\/li><li><b>Related Projects ::<\/b> <a href=\"#cases99;balloonFlyto\">CASES99<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"

                "desc": "<p>Of the so-called atmospheric greenhouse gases, water vapor is the most effective in producing surface-atmospheric warming. Water-vapor concentrations increase rapidly over the tropical oceans when sea surface temperatures (SSTs) begin to rise (as in global warming scenarios, for example). This effect is greatest over the huge \"warm pools\" of the Pacific Ocean. The water- vapor content of the atmosphere above the ocean increases by about 15\u201420% for each 1% of increase in SST. These increasing concentrations of water vapor trap more and more heat, which causes the ocean's surface temperature to rise even further, thus creating a \"super-greenhouse effect.\" Unchecked, this feedback mechanism would result in runaway warming. This is not what is observed, however; even in the \"warm pool,\" SSTs never exceed 304 K (31\u00baC). This suggests that some kind of \"thermostat\" might exist. Furthermore, deep intensive convection over the tropical ocean\u2014with cloud tops reaching altitudes of 18 to 20 km\u2014only when SSTs exceed about 300 K.

EDW is but one example of a pervasive tendency for mode waters to form adjacent to strong baroclinic fronts in all the world's oceans. EDW is a canonical example of a subtropical mode water, all of which are found in regions of significant air-sea exchange. EDW is created in the winter just south of the Gulf Stream, by convection in the presence of strong shear, with competing effects of vertical\/lateral mixing and advection\/stirring colluding to set its properties. This project stems from two years of CLIVAR planning (with advice and support of both the Atlantic and US CLIVAR committees) to develop an experiment to attack a key process that is poorly understood and poorly represented in ocean climate models - i.e. the treatment of convection, eddy and mixing processes in setting properties of subtropical mode waters, the associated air-sea interaction, and the exchange of fluid between the mixed layer and the upper ocean. The scientific goals of CLIMODE are focused in 4 areas:<\/p><ul>    <li>Air Sea Interaction<\/li>    <li>Eddies and Mixing<\/li>    <li>Subduction & Circulation<\/li>    <li>Modeling<\/li><\/ul><p>Our program is a mix of in situ and satellite-based observations, and modeling which will, over a 5 year period beginning October 2004, lead to improved parameterization of air-sea fluxes in a high exchange region of the oceans, and improved ocean physics in climate models, capturing the eddy-mixed layer interactions in a region with both strong flows within the ocean and atmosphere and large wintertime exchange between the ocean and atmosphere.<\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www.climode.org\/index.html<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>9 November 2005 - 19 November, 2007<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>various research vessels based out of Woods Hole, Massachusetts<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>Integrated Sounding Systems (ISS) & Data Management<\/li><li><b>Related Projects ::<\/b> <a href=\"#vocals;balloonFlyto\">VOCALS<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"

These various interactions are complex and not fully understood. However, the processes are crucial in determining the eventual overall effect of manmade greenhouse gases on the earth\u2019s climate. The detailed measurements from the Crystal-Face mission will assist in improving our climate models. Six aircraft will be equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to measure characteristics of clouds and how clouds alter the atmosphere\u2019s temperature. These measurements will be compared with ground based radars, satellites, and the results of advanced atmospheric models, in order to improve our ability to forecast future climate change. This large multi-agency experiment will unite seven NASA centers, NOAA, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Office of Naval Research, U.S. Weather Research Program, Universities and other government weather researchers in this well coordinated study of our environment.<\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www.espo.nasa.gov\/crystalface\/<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>1 April - 21 July, 2002 <\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Southern Florida<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b><\/li><ul><li>Electra Doppler Radar (ELDORA)<\/li><li>Dropsonde System<\/li><li>Data Management<\/li><\/ul><\/ul>"

The first five years of FIRE and ISCCP have yielded significant progress toward these objectives. ISCCP has designed a methodology for monitoring cloudiness from space; this methodology has been employed to collect a near-global cloud climatology since 1983. This data set is now being used by scientists studying cloud and climate questions. For the future, the relationship between clouds and climate has been identified as the top research priority for the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

Following this line, many projects continue to be set in unforested places with little topographic variation. Studies of meteorology in \"complex terrain\" have focused on extremely mountainous regions, such as the Rockies or the Alps. Between these extremes is a large expanse of regions with moderately complex topography and more complicated land surfaces, places where people live and weather and pollution forecasts must be made. With the rapid increase in quality and quantity of remote sensing imagery, many are proposing techniques to reduce surface boundary conditions to counting tiles in the appropriate mosaic. How will these approaches be tested? In this project, we turn deliberately to study this intermediate ground. We believe that many of the problems associated with the lack of horizontal homogeneity can be offset by the appearance of regular local winds, which make it easier to form useful composites. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/sequoia.asrc.cestm.albany.edu\/jrgroup\/jrgHVAMS.htm<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>4 September - 4 November, 2003 <\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Hudson River Valley, New York<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>Integrated Surface Flux Facility (ISFF) & Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"

In particular, they wish to have the opportunity to access facilities that are not easily available to them, such as research aircraft, but are essential for testing new instruments they have or are developing.

Orographic precipitation systems are good candidates for IMPROVE studies because much of the forcing is tied to the terrain, and the terrain is precisely known. Thus, in situations where essentially steady flow impinges on a topographic barrier and the upstream conditions are known, the dynamical response to that flow is highly deterministic, provided the forecast model can properly resolve the key terrain-forced dynamics (Colle and Mass 1996). In addition, terrain-forced flow produces large gradients in cloud microphysical variables and processes, providing a good test bed for the model microphysics. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/improve.atmos.washington.edu\/<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>1 January - 14 February, 2001<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Coastal Regions of Washington State<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>S-POL Radar, Integrated Sounding System (ISS), & Data Management<\/li><li><b>Related Projects ::<\/b> <a href=\"#improveI;balloonFlyto\">IMPROVE I<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"

These tiny particles, of about a millionth of a centimeter or smaller in diameter, scatter sunlight back to space and cause a regional cooling effect. These aerosols consisting of sulfates, soot, organic carbon and mineral dust are produced both naturally and by human activities. Results of numerous global warming models suggest that the aerosol cooling is one of the largest, if not the largest, sources of uncertainty in predicting future climate. Still, the complex influence of aerosol cooling on global warming is not clearly understood. This issue will remain a mystery unless field experiments, such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), are undertaken to collect in-situ data on the regional cooling effect of sulfate and other aerosols.<\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www-indoex.ucsd.edu\/index.html<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>1 January - 31 March, 1999<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Maldive Islands<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>NSF\/NCAR C-130 Aircraft & Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"

However, the Doppler beam swinging technique commonly used assumes an homogenous wind field over its multiple beam directions. NCAR is developing a boundary layer Doppler interferometric profiler which implements interferometric techniques by using multiple receivers in order to derive the three wind components from a single transmitted beam direction. <\/p><p>This innovative method should also prove extremely well suited for accurate estimations of the momentum flux in the atmospheric boundary layer. In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of the interferometric profiler by comparing its results with in-situ measurements of the momentum flux obtained by aircraft. These airborne measurements are crucial to the success of the experiment as aircraft are the scientifically accepted standard for measuring momentum fluxes in the boundary layer. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/data.eol.ucar.edu\/codiac\/projs?Momentum%20Flux<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>10 November-17 November, 1992<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Mid-Western United States<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>University of Wyoming King Air (UWKA) & Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"

Improvement of 0-48 hr cool season quantitative precipitation depends on obtaining a greater understanding of the mesoscale structure and dynamics of cyclonic weather systems. <p>The PLOWS research program is targeted directly at this problem. The field campaign will also provide new insight concerning remote sensing of winter weather systems that can translate directly into better operational interpretation and observation strategies of winter weather mesoscale features. Furthermore, the study will provide a unique dataset which can be used to interpret data from the next generation of operational polarization diversity Doppler radars to be deployed in the next decade. Our  modeling studies with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will determine if modeled precipitation substructures are consistent with observed features in winter storm systems and provide a better understanding of processes responsible for the occurrence of those substructures. <\/P><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www.atmos.illinois.edu\/plows\/<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates ::<\/b> November 1, 2009 - February 28, 2010<\/li><li><b>Location ::<\/b> Mid-Western United Sates<\/li><li><b>Facility ::<\/b> <\/li><ul><li>NSF\/NCAR C-130 Aircraft<\/li><li>Integrated Sounding System (ISS)<\/li><li>Dropsonde System<\/li><li>Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR)<\/li><\/ul><\/ul>"

Chandrasekar. <\/p><p>The experiment was designed to collect polarimetric radar data sets that could be compared with ground based precipitation observations (i.e., hydrometeor types, sizes, accumulation rates, etc.). These surface observations offered a verification standard against which various radar-derived characterizations of winter precipitation could be tested. Dedicated surface weather observations were made at the state climate network station on the CSU campus, and at NCAR's Marshall field installation near Boulder. The S-POL radar was operated from the Eastlake site (approximately 55 km southwest of CSU-CHILL). Coordinated dual Doppler scans were conducted by the two radars at 30 minute intervals. The overall data set collected in PROWS should usefully expand techniques for remotely sensing winter season precipitation with dual polarization radars. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/data.eol.ucar.edu\/codiac\/projs?PROWS97<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>15 January - 31 March, 1997<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Boulder, CO<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>S-POL Radar & Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"

Developing such a SGS model requires data that separate the turbulent motion into two components: filtered and SGS fields. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/www.mmm.ucar.edu\/community\/sgs2000.html<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>1 September - 1 October, 2000 <\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>San Joaquin Valley, California<\/li><li><b>EOL Facilities :: <\/b>Integrated Surface Flux Facility (ISFF) & Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"

Surface boundary conditions play an important role in initiation and maintenance of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS), which controls summer precipitation over much of this region.<\/p><p>Understanding these processes is a focus for the North American Monsoon Experiment. A working hypothesis is that among the land surface antecedent boundary conditions that control the onset and intensity of the NAMS is soil moisture. The influence of the land surface is relayed through surface evaporation and associated surface cooling (dependent on soil moisture), terrain, and vegetation cover. Soil moisture and, in particular, surface wetness, can change dramatically after heavy rain events. Increased soil moisture after precipitation promotes evapotranspiration between storm events. This may contribute to enhanced convection and further precipitation.<\/p><p>As part of NAME there will be an intensive observing period in the summer of 2004 over the Tier I domain. The intention of SMEX04-NAME is to enhance the terrestrial hydrology component of NAME by facilitating development of soil moisture. Specific activities include the provision of soil moisture products from the existing in situ network in Arizona and the development of an equivalent network within a study region in Mexico, and soil moisture products derived from existing satellite sensors on Aqua and TRMM. An intensive ground and aircraft field campaign will take place during August 2004 that will provide validation of the in situ and satellite products. SMEX04-NAME will also address important algorithm and validation issues for existing satellite based soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer and future low frequency instruments. <\/p><p>For more information :: http:\/\/hydrolab.arsusda.gov\/smex04\/<\/p><ul><li><b>Dates :: <\/b>1 July - 31 August, 2004<\/li><li><b>Location :: <\/b>Southwestern Arizona & Northwestern Mexico<\/li><li><b>EOL Facility :: <\/b>Data Management<\/li><\/ul>"
