The station was moved to Cordova Auto Rental, a small business operating near the Cordova airport, about 12 miles from the town.  Except for a nearby aeronautical navigation beacon, the location is very radio-quiet.  (The navigation beacon interference is removed with an RF filter.)  The horizon is low in all directions so low-elevation satellite passes are obtainable.  The antenna is mounted atop an 8\u2019 x 40\u2019 steel cargo container, which provides a good ground plane.  The receiver and computer are inside the Rental office, inside a TV-enclosure type cabinet.  Communication with the Cordova station is via the local telephone cooperative.  Cordova Telephone, in turn, communicates with the outside world entirely by satellite communication.  There are occasional outages, but they are rarely longer than a few hours.<br><br>Other receiver outages (not caused by the Telephone system) usually require the help of someone on-site.

The location of the station is an 8\u2019 x 8\u2019 science experiment shelter located near the Arctic Village airport.  This facility is owned and operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  Indeed, the actual installation and most subsequent work has been by an employee of UAF, Ms. Kay Lawson.<br><br>The difficulty at Arctic Village is twofold; communication with the outside world, and radio interference.  The facility had (and has) a telephone connection, so initially it was believed that communication would be similar to Cordova.  That is, there is a copper telephone connection from the receiver station to the village, and, then, a satellite link to the rest of the world.  However, the satellite link is vastly far below Cordova in terms of data transmission speed.  The solution was to set up our own link from the station to a second (Internet-only) satellite station within the village.  This was done in concert with an Alaska-wide program to provide Internet access to all Alaskans, regardless of the size of the villages they lived in.  This system, by itself, works adequately, albeit very slowly at times.  The problem is that the Internet connection equipment is, itself, a source of interference to ITS10 operations.  The solution here was to program the Internet connection equipment to power-down during a satellite pass.  This mode of operation did eliminate the equipment interference, but sometime during the setup, testing, and eventual power-on - power-off operating mode, another source of interference has come into being.<br><br>Arctic Village operation remains poor in terms of the amount of useful data obtained from the site.  We are investigating an alternative location for this receiver, perhaps at the Toolik Field Site, operated for the National Science Foundation by the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.  This site is on the main road from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, and would provide better communications and on-site support.<\/p>"

It is designed to transmit a narrow beam of high power radio signals in the 2.8 to 10 MHz frequency range. Its antenna is built on a gravel pad having dimensions of 1000' x 1200' (about 33 acres). There are 180 towers, 72' in height mounted on thermopiles spaced 80' apart in a 12 x 15 rectangular grid. Each tower supports near its top, two pairs of crossed dipole antennas, one for the low band (2.8 to 8.3 MHz), the other for the high band (7 to 10 MHz). The antenna system is surrounded by an exclusion fence to prevent possible damage to the antenna towers or harm to large animals. An elevated ground screen, attached to the towers at the 15' level, acts as a reflector for the antenna array while allowing vehicular access underneath to 30 environmentally-controlled transmitter shelters spaced throughout the array. Each shelter contains 6 pairs of 10 kW transmitters, for a total of 6 x 30 x 2 x 10 kW = 3600 kW available for transmission. The transmitters can be switched to drive either the low or high band antennas. Electric prime power is provided from an on-site power plant housing five, 2500 kW generators, each driven by a 3600 hp diesel engine. Four generators are required for operation of the IRI and the fifth is held as a spare. From a control room within the Operations Center, the transmission from each of the 180 crossed-dipole antennas is adjusted in a precise manner under computer control. In this manner, the complete array of antennas forms a narrow antenna pattern pointed upward toward the ionosphere. The transmitted signal diverges (spreads out) as it travels upward and is partially absorbed, at an altitude which depends on the transmitted HF frequency, in a small volume several tens of miles in diameter and a few hundred meters thick directly over the facility. The remainder of the transmitted signal either reflects back toward the earth or passes through the ionosphere into space, continuing to diverge as it does so. By the time it reaches the ionosphere, the intensity of the HF signal is less than 3 microwatts (0.000003 watt) per cm2, thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less, even, than the variations in intensity of the Sun's natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere.<br><br><img alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"http:\/\/climateviewer.org\/img\/gallery\/HAARP_IRI_dipole.jpg\" \/><br><br><img alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"http:\/\/climateviewer.org\/img\/gallery\/HAARP_array1.jpg\" \/><br><br><img alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"http:\/\/climateviewer.org\/img\/gallery\/HAARP_arrayC.jpg\" \/><\/p>"

In the early part of the chart (to the left) the green and blue curves overlap, indicating that the cosmic noise observed by the riometer is very close to the expected value. Beginning at about 1400 UTC on 29 January, however, the measured noise (blue curve) drops below the quiet day curve and the ionospheric absorption (red curve), as calculated by the riometer, begins to rise. After a short time, the measured noise returns to the quiet level (at 1600 UTC) but then drops again in response to another absorption event.
