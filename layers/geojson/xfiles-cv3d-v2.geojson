The lightweight honeycomb sandwich primary mirror weighs 4,5OO pounds and has a one-inch thick glass facesheet. The surface is polished to a precision of 21 nanometers, 3,OOO times thinner than a human hair. The mirror is supported by 56 computer-controlled actuators to maintain the surface figure while the telescope is moving. The mirror was installed in August 1993, and first light images were achieved on February 10, 1994. <br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/space\/systems\/starfire.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Global Security<\/a><br><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/space\/systems\/starfire.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" alt=\"ClimateViewer 3D\"  src=\"http:\/\/climateviewer.org\/img\/gallery\/starfire-optical-range-5.jpg\"\/><\/a><\/p>"

The instrument for lidar measurements consists of two parts, an emitter and a receiver. The emitter sends laser pulses into the atmosphere. There the laser light gets scattered by particles and molecules, partly also backwards to the lidar. There the receiver detects the light which was scattered backwards. Since the speed of light is constant, the time between the emission of the laser pulse and detection at the receiver tells us at which height the light was scattered. Changes in intensity can reveal clouds which are invisible for the eye (but important for climate research).<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irf.se\/program\/afp\/lidar\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"http:\/\/climateviewer.org\/img\/gallery\/kiruna_lidar.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>"

The Davis lidar is one of only three Antarctic lidars that can probe the mesosphere (the layer between altitudes of 50 km and 95 km).<br><br>The Davis lidar measures atmospheric density, temperature, wind velocity and aerosol loading as a function of altitude. The altitude range is normally between 10 km and 65 km, although certain types of measurement can be made to altitudes of 95 km.<br><br>The lidar data are normally collected with a vertical resolution of 94 metres, although a resolution as high as 18 metres is available. The data are typically obtained with an integration time of 60 seconds.<br><br>The light beam transmitted by the lidar comes from a pulsed solid state (Nd:YAG) laser at a wavelength of 532nm (in the green part of the optical spectrum). The average power of the laser is 30 Watts; each laser pulse comprises about 3 billion times more photons than the output from a standard electric light globe. About 25% of the laser light transmitted into the sky is scattered or absorbed within the atmosphere - the rest continues out into space.<br><br>The laser light is transmitted into the sky by a Cassegrain telescope with a 1-metre diameter primary mirror. The telescope also collects the backscattered light, and can be pointed within 45 degress of overhead. A mirror spinning at 400 revolutions per second allows the lidar to switch between transmitting and receiving modes.<br><br>The most novel aspect of the Davis lidar is its ability to measure atmospheric temperatures and winds using a technique known as 'incoherent Doppler lidar'. This involves making very high resolution measurements of the spectrum of the laser light backscattered from the sky using a scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometer, and being able to move the telescope around the sky.<br><br>http:\/\/www.antarctica.gov.au\/about-antarctica\/fact-files\/studying-the-atmosphere\/probing-the-atmosphere-with-lidar<\/p>"

Multiple reflections between mirrors located at the extremities of each arm extend the effective optical length of each arm up to 120 kilometers. Virgo is located within the site of EGO, European Gravitational Observatory, based at Cascina, near Pisa on the river Arno plain.<br><br>The frequency range of Virgo extends from 10 to 6,000 Hz.

To achieve it, Italian and French scientists involved in the project, have developed most advanced techniques in the field of high power ultrastable lasers, high reflectivity mirrors, seismic isolation and position and alignment control.<br><br>In the field of optics, Virgo uses a new generation of ultrastable lasers, and the most stable oscillator ever built.

This instrument, and its sister interferometric detectors, when operational, are some of the most sensitive gravitational wave detectors ever designed. They are designed to detect relative changes in distance of the order of one part in 10\u221221, about the size of a single atom compared to the distance from the Sun to the Earth. GEO 600 is capable of detecting gravitational waves in the frequency range 50 Hz to 1.5 kHz.[1] Construction on the project began in 1995<br><br>In November 2005, it was announced that the LIGO and GEO instruments have begun an extended joint science run. The three instruments (LIGO's instruments are located near Livingston, Louisiana and on the Hanford Site, Washington in the U.S.) will collect data for more than a year, with breaks for tuning and updates. This will be the fifth science run of GEO 600. No signals were detected on previous runs, but the sensitivity of the instruments (and the quality of the data analysis) is continually improving, and once the data from the current run are analyzed, it is hoped that they will perhaps reveal the arrival at Earth of two unambiguous bursts of gravitational waves. This would constitute the first direct detection of gravitational radiation.<br><br> <h3>Claimed link between GEO 600 detector noise and holographic properties of spacetime<\/h3><br><br>On January 15, 2009, it was reported in New Scientist that some yet unidentified noise that was present in the GEO 600 detector measurements might be because the instrument is sensitive to extremely small quantum fluctuations of space-time affecting the positions of parts of the detector.[3] This claim was made by Craig Hogan, a scientist from Fermilab, on the basis of his own theory of how such fluctuations should occur motivated by the holographic principle.[4]<br><br>The New Scientist story states that Hogan sent his prediction of \"holographic noise\" to the GEO 600 collaboration in June 2008, and subsequently received a plot of the excess noise which \"looked exactly the same as my prediction\". However, Hogan knew before that time that the experiment was finding excess noise. Hogan's article published in Physical Review D in May 2008 states: \"The approximate agreement of predicted holographic noise with otherwise unexplained noise in GEO 600 motivates further study.\"[5] Hogan cites a 2007 talk from the GEO 600 collaboration which already mentions \"mid-band 'mystery' noise\", and where the noise spectra are plotted.[6] A similar remark was made (\"In the region between 100 Hz and 500 Hz a discrepancy between the uncorrelated sum of all noise projections and the actual observed sensitivity is found.\") in a GEO 600 paper submitted in October 2007 and published in May 2008.<br><br>It is also a very common occurrence for gravitational wave detectors to find excess noise that is subsequently eliminated. According to Karsten Danzmann, the GEO 600 principal investigator, \"The daily business of improving the sensitivity of these experiments always throws up some excess noise (...). We work to identify its cause, get rid of it and tackle the next source of excess noise.\"[3] Additionally, some new estimates of the level of holographic noise in interferometry show that it must be much smaller in magnitude than was claimed by Hogan.[8]<br><br>http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GEO_600<\/p>"

Everyone is familiar these days with the blurry and pixelatedimages, or noisy sound transmission, associated with poor internetbandwidth.  The Holometer seeks to detect the equivalent blurriness ornoise in reality itself, associated with the ultimate frequency limitimposed by nature.<\/p><p>About a hundred years ago, the German physicist Max Planck introducedthe idea of a fundamental, natural length or time, derived fromfundamental constants. We now call these the Planck length,<code>l<sub>p<\/sub> = \u221a<span style=\"border-top: 1px solid;\">hG\/2\u03c0 c<sup>3<\/sup><\/span> = 1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-35<\/sup><\/code> meters.

For example, a particle confined to a Planck volumeautomatically collapses to a black hole.<\/p><p>More recently, theoretical studies of black holes, and later in stringtheory and other forms of unification, have suggested that physics onthe Planck scale is holographic. It is conjectured that space is twodimensional, and the third dimension is inextricably linked with time.If so, our three-dimensional world is a kind of approximate illusionthat emerges only on scales much larger than the Planck length.<\/p><p>It could be that the illusion is imperfect and blurry. The maximumfrequency may introduce a particular kind of noise or jitter intospacetime, as measured by the propagation of light in differentdirections.<\/p><p>The holometer attempts a direct experimental test of one form of thishypothesis. In a Michelson interferometer, a light beam is split intotwo parts that travel in different directions, then are brought backtogether. The vibrations of light in the two directions tend to driftapart by about Planck length per Planck time when they are travelingin different directions. When they are recombined, the difference inlight phase can be measured.  In the holometer, signals from twodifferent interferometers -- that is, two completely separate systems,each with its own pair of beam arms -- are compared. If they are closeenough to probe the same volume of spacetime -- that is, if light inboth systems is travelling in about the same direction, at about thesame time -- their signals should display the same, correlated jitter,sometimes called \"holographic noise\".<\/p><p>Measurement of holographic noise would be the first directexperimental access to the Planck scale, and provide fundamentalinsights into the fundamental nature of space and time. It woulddirectly measure the Planck time, and the absolute natural bound oninformation transmission, about 10^43 bits per second.<\/p><p><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"http:\/\/holometer.fnal.gov\/images\/experiments3-large.png\"><\/p><p>This  plot shows the sensitivity of various experiments to fluctuations inspace and time.

Thesensitivities shown for the operating gravitational waveinterferometers, GEO600 and LIGO, represent the published noise indifferential arm length measurement, achieved in one wave cycle at themost sensitive frequency, as a function of apparatus size. (In thecase of LIGO, this estimate applies to holographic shear fluctuations,not to gravitational waves; its sensitivity to gravitational waves ismuch better.) In the case of LISA, the projected noise is shown. Inthe case of the Holometer, by cross correlating two co-locatedinterferometers, the greater sensitivity is achieved in spite ofshorter arms, by integrating for many cycles; sensitivity is shown foran hour-long integration. At the Megahertz frequency of the Holometer,acoustic crosstalk is expected to be negligible. This apparatus willbe the most sensitive in the world to holographic fluctuations ofspacetime, and the first experiment to achieve Planckian sensitivity.<\/p><p>The project is currently in the design stage.        <\/p>"

These RCS ranges are used to test aeroforms (shapes to be incorporated into aerodynamic vehicles) for their radar reflectivity. At one end of the range is an array of radio and radar dishes used to measure the profile of the shape, which is mounted several hundred yards or so down the range on a triangular pedestal. The large box structure, visible from miles away, is a movable gantry, used to install the aeroforms on top of the test pylons, which are visible as white triangular forms on the runway area. In 2000, the property was acquired by the Aeronautical Systems division of San Diego-based General Atomics, which developed the Predator and Gnat UAVs.
