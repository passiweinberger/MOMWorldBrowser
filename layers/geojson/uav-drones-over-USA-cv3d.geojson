Operation of a Honeywell MAV in class G airspace at or below 400 feet AGL.  The operation will launch, operate and recover within the fenced in boundries of an abandoned group of buildings located in the Everglades. The flights will occur in day VFR conditions for the purpose of training and testing the MAV to develop safety and operations procedures. COA for 2011-ESA-4: Due to the nature of its intended use the Miami-Dade Police Department is requesting the ability to utilize the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) up to and including 300' AGL in .  This would enable the MAV to show an aerial view of most residences from overhead.  It would enable the on scene tactical commander to view all four sides of a structure in real time and allow him to make decisions based on this information.  This would increase his situational awareness and safety to officers while reducing radio transmissions.  This altitude would also avoid any potential conflicts by providing a level of separation between the MAV and other Air Traffic. The pilot and/or Observer are to maintain line of sight contact and visual observation of the MAV while in flight and remain within 2000 feet laterally of the MAV.  The request for this increased distance is that the MAV Program was intended in situations where a subject was either known or suspected to be in possession of a long gun where utilization of traditional aviation assets would pose an increased risk to the aircrew and aircraft.  This distance is easily achievable by a skilled gunman with a rifle and/or a scope but would give the aircrew additional flexibility in site selection.  In urban areas this additional distance would not be necessary but with some of the more rural areas of MDC the added distance would provide more options for the MAV crew.   The MAV will not be intentionally flown over non-hostile personnel or vehicles, nor used in vehicle pursuits or operated from a moving vehicle and/or aircraft.</p><p> <b>Effective Dates:</b> 2011-ESA-56: 9/23/2011-9/22/2012 2011-ESA-4: 7/1/2011-6/30/2012 (but it looks like Miami-Dade has had COAs since at least 2008)</p><p> <b>Comments:</b> The \"COA Status Document\" for notes that \"This COA is for training and testing of pilots and UAS at the designated operations training area only.

(see \"COA_SPECIAL_CIRCUM_DOC4.pdf\") This document notes that \"8 incidents [involving Predators] occurred over a period of 79,177 flying hours. Further analysis of these incidents reveals that all occurred in congested airspace. 4 HATRs were attributed to task saturation of air traffic controllers, 2 were attributed to poor radio coverage, and 2 were attributed to UAS pilot error. Of the two pilot errors, both occurred during inclement weather that would have precluded operations in a non-combat environment.\" (see p. 8) This document also has a risk assessment table on p. 8. \"VISUAL_OBSERVER3.pdf\" is a 37-page training presentation for visual observers.</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011</a></p> </div></div>"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPoint","coordinates":[[-103.266348,34.575157,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Name":"Air Force - 2011-ESA-17-COA","Description":"<div style=\"width:330px;height:240px;overflow:auto\"><div class=\"googft-info-window\" style=\"font-family:sans-serif\"> <b>Governmental Body/Entity:</b> Air Force - 2011-ESA-17-COA<br><p> <b>Type of Drone:</b> Aqua Puma</p><p><b>Status:</b> Active</p><p> <b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Chesapeake, VA</p><p> <b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> The objective of this COA is to designate a UAS operational area to ensure Special Operations Forces (SOF) are able to maintain proficiency and conduct operator qualification training.

The Government also purchased a perpetual restrictive easement in approximately 125,000 acres of land, commonly referred to as the “buffer zone,” surrounding the test facility and extending about six miles in all directions. Although most of the buffer zone is privately owned, the area is uninhabited because the Government’s easement prohibits habitable structures, including mobile homes, campers, trailers or other enclosed structures. However, the easement does not prohibit landowners from using lands within the buffer zone for activities that do not violate the easement restriction, such as timber production, grazing, haying, agriculture, fishing ponds, mineral extraction, and recreational activities.

However, the Army has had a bunch of problems with the A160 crashing and may not continue the program: http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A8933f134-8535-4016-86c8-ed18ec6f2cf5</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011</a></p> </div></div>"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPoint","coordinates":[[-117.291157,34.536107,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Name":"Air Force - 2011-WSA-55-COA","Description":"<div style=\"width:330px;height:240px;overflow:auto\"><div class=\"googft-info-window\" style=\"font-family:sans-serif\"> <b>Governmental Body/Entity:</b> Air Force - 2011-WSA-55-COA<br><p> <b>Type of Drone:</b> Wasp (BATMAV) Small UAS</p><p><b>Status:</b> </p><p> <b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Camp Rilea, OR</p><p> <b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> Objective is to provide operator currency for the 125th Special Tactics Squadron personnel using the Wasp (BATMAV) Small UAS.</p><p> <b>Effective Dates:</b> 8/5/2011-8/4/2012</p><p> <b>Comments:</b> </p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011</a></p> </div></div>"},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPoint","coordinates":[[-123.931532,46.116494,0]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Name":"US Marine Corps - 2011-ESA-25-COA","Description":"<div style=\"width:330px;height:240px;overflow:auto\"><div class=\"googft-info-window\" style=\"font-family:sans-serif\"> <b>Governmental Body/Entity:</b> US Marine Corps - 2011-ESA-25-COA<br><p> <b>Type of Drone:</b> RQ-7B Shadow</p><p><b>Status:</b> Active</p><p> <b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Carteret, NC</p><p> <b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> The USMC has a requirement to operate its Shadow 200 UAS RQ-7B aircraft at MCALF Bogue in support of aircrew training, expeditionary site setup, and integration into large force exercises at Camp Lejeune.  This requires the system to transit from 0 - 1200 ft within the class D airspace and into the R5306C restricted airspace in order to properly train squadron aircrews in the effective employment of the new system and to transit to the other adjoining restricted airspace. VMU-2 will fly an average of three (3) to four (4) training flights per day while conducting operations out of MCALF Bogue.  All flights will strictly adhere to a pre-established UAV pattern within the lateral confines of the Class D airspace while using a ground/tower observer until established in the R5306C restricted airspace.  Operations will be conducted Monday through Friday.  Each flight will last approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.</p><p> <b>Effective Dates:</b> 11/1/2011-10/31/2012</p><p> <b>Comments:</b> Docs withheld under exemption 3 (22 USC 2751) (this statute is about foreign arms sales &amp; information subject to arms export controls.
