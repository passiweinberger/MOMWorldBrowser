When completed, it will likely be the largest eavesdropping facility every created, employing more than four thousand civilian and military \"voice interceptors\" and other specialists. Run by the ultra-secret National Security Agency, it is where the agency eavesdrops on the Middle East and Northern Africa, thousands of miles away. Inside, behind barbed-wire fences, heavily armed guards, and cipher-locked doors, earphone-clad men and women secretly listen in as al-Qaeda members chat on cell phones along the Afghan border, and to insurgents planning attacks in Iraq. The also target and record American citizens in that region, including businesspeople, journalists, and Red Cross workers, as they engage in intimate conversations with their spouses back home and discuss confidential matters and business deals. \"A lot of the time you could tell they were calling their families,\" said one of the NSA intercept operators who listened in on Americans, \"incredibly initimate, personal conversations . . .

Originally activated in 1942 as Monitor Station One at Vint Hill Farms Station, Warrenton, Va., the 748th MI Battalion, 702d MI Group, INSCOM, stands as an example of ‘change to meet the Army’s needs.’ One of its first changes was a relocation to Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. Another change was its redesignation as the U.S. Army Security Agency Field Station San Antonio with two companies.<br /><br /> At that time, the unit became part of the Consolidated Security Operations (now the Medina Regional SIGINT Operations Center) which was jointly manned by the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force. It was (and still is) located at the Medina Annex of Lackland Air Force Base. The unit was redesignated the U.S. Army Field Station San Antonio in May 1980.<br /><br /> Company B evolved into Headquarters and Headquarters Company. Company A deactivated on Jan. 10, 1983, then reactivated on Oct. 14, 1987. Company B was reactivated on Oct. 6, 1993. On Jan 1, 1988, the unit was redesignated the 748th MI Battalion. The 749th Military Intelligence Company, Key West, Fla., was subordinated to the battalion on June 1, 1988. The 749th MI Company was later deactivated July 8, 1993.<br /><br /> On June 1, 1996, the 748th MI Battalion was resubordinated to the 702d MI Group, Fort Gordon, Ga., from the 704th MI Brigade, Fort George G.

Even more jobs could be added as the site develops in several phases, according to the NSA. Nationwide, the NSA is hiring up to 4,500 employees through 2008 and some of those employees will be located here, according to an e-mail message from Ellen Cioccio, an NSA spokeswoman. The NSA already has about 2,000 people at Lackland AFB's Medina Annex. In addition, a group of experienced analysts will transfer from NSA's Fort Meade, Md., headquarters to San Antonio. They will be here to train the military and new civilian employees, Cioccio said.<br /><br /> The San Antonio NSA office includes personnel from the Army, Marine Corps., Navy, Air Force and the civilian Defense Department. \"NSA is expanding its presence in San Antonio as part of our transformation efforts and as a result of the lessons learned from our global war on terrorism experiences,\" according to Cioccio. San Antonio beat out sites in Georgia and Hawaii for the NSA expansion project. San Antonio was chosen because the NSA already has a large, growing presence here.<br /><br /> The new NSA site, at Loop 410 and Military Drive, consists of two connected buildings that contain office and research and development space totaling about 475,000 square feet. Those buildings could be expanded by several thousand more square feet. In addition, Office Properties Trust plans to buy 43 more acres around the 50-acre Sony Campus. The campus has the ability to accommodate three more buildings and its developers eventually expect the site to exceed 1 million square feet, making it the city's second largest office park after USAA's headquarters on the North Side. The developers need to do some remodeling to the site to accommodate the NSA operations, which are expected to begin moving in this fall.<br /><br /> Already, San Antonio has a strong presence of cyber security operations and research with existing NSA operations and the U.S. Air Force Intelligence Agency at Lackland, nicknamed Security Hill. The University of Texas at San Antonio also is one of 59 universities in the nation recognized by the NSA, which designated it a center for academic excellence in information assurance education. With its growing expertise, San Antonio has developed a reputation nationwide as a top-notch information security city, said U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez. And since 9-11 and Gulf War II, the U.S. government has been beefing up its intelligence agencies and particularly its operations here, he said.<br /><br /> The Texas Congressional delegation received a briefing on the NSA expansion in San Antonio on Thursday. The project has been kept top secret because of its mission. \"It's a sophisticated operation in every way,\" Gonzalez said. \"This is a great opportunity for individuals in San Antonio.\" The site will be a major intelligence campus of the NSA and one of the largest campuses outside of Fort Meade, where the NSA has between 20,000 and 30,000 employees and operates like a small city. The NSA must expand outside of Washington because they've run out of room at their current site, Bamford said. The San Antonio site will also help diversify the agency and not make them as vulnerable in the event of an attack, he said. On May 4, the NSA will have a career fair at the Omni Hotel in San Antonio. The agency is looking to hire intelligence analysts, language experts, computer scientists, mathematicians, signals analysts, accountants, financial analysts, investigators and police officers.
