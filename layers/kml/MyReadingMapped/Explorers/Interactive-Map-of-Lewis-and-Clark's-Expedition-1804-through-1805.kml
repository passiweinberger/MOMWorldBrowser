According to local legend, when Meriwether Lewis learned that a male child had been born near the expedition's encampment in what is today southeastern South Dakota, he sent for the child and wrapped the new born baby boy in an American flag during the council at Calumet Bluff in late August 1804. Lewis declared the baby an American. This boy grew up to become a headman (chief) of the Ihanktonwan Dakota (Yankton Sioux), known as Struck By-the-Ree.

I should have returned from hence but hearing a tremendious roaring above me I continued my rout across the point of a hill a few hundred yards further and was again presented by one of the most beatifull objects in nature, a cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular streching at rightangles across the river from side to side to the distance of at least a quarter of amile. here the river pitches over a shelving rock, with an edge as regular and as streight as if formed by art, without a nich or brake in it; the water decends in one even and uninterupted sheet to the bottom wher dashing against the rocky bottom rises into foaming billows of great hight and rappidly glide away, hising flashing and sparkling as it departs the sprey rises from on eextremity to the other to 50 f.”]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[For over 200 years there has been wide speculation in the media, such as Smithsonian, and in books as to whether Meriwether Lewis died at Grinder's Stand of suicide or by murder. One such speculation presented by the History Channel 2 show America Unearthed: Motive for Murder, states that one of the tasks Lewis was given to achieve on his expedition was to determine if there was an ancient Welsh claim on the Louisiana territory, and the show attempts to prove whether Lewis was murdered because he found the Welsh claim on the Louisiana territory to be true. If Lewis was murdered, and pages were torn out of his journal, it was to protect Jefferson's purchase of the Louisiana territory and that the French sold us land they did not own. The show also claims the Mandarin tribe that Lewis lived with for so many months had a striking European appearance.]]></description>
