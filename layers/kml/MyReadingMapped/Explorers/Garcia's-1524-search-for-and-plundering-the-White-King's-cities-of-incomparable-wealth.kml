The recorded history of Paraguay began indirectly in 1516 with the failed expedition of Juan Díaz de Solís to the Río de la Plata Estuary, which divides Argentina and Uruguay. After Solís's death at the hands of Indians, the expedition renamed the estuary Río de Solís and sailed back to Spain. On the home voyage, one of the vessels was wrecked off Santa Catarina Island near the Brazilian coast. Among the survivors was Aleixo García, a Portuguese adventurer who had acquired a working knowledge of Guaraní. García was intrigued by reports of "the White King" who, it was said, lived far to the west and governed cities of incomparable wealth and splendor. For nearly eight years, García patiently mustered men and supplies for a trip to the interior and finally left Santa Catarina with several European companions to raid the dominions of "El Rey Blanco."]]></description>

Garcia and his party reached the broad Parana, crossed it in canoes and, then, undoubtedly due to their Guarani companions, travelled from one village to another without mishap until arriving at the Rio Paraguay somewhere near the present day site of Asuncion. Here, the Iberians found a large concentration of Indians—a ready-made army for Garcia. Like their Paraguayan descendants of today, these Guarani were in general a friendly and easy-going race, but capable of great bravery and equal ferocity in war.]]></description>

I was drawn to the giant stone circle of Jasuká Renda, 11 hills in a circle which is the spiritual heart of the Guarani culture and I fell asleep cocooned in a cave etched with ancient rock art. Jasuká is known as the grandmother of the universe, from whose breasts the creator was nourished. At the heart of the Guarani world, is the divine feminine. I fell asleep, safe and warm, in her womb.

Also in Jasuká income found numerous inscriptions, still very little studied. So the hill is considered by the Guarani as the most important of the 11 hills. Your name say "Place of Jasuká" which is a female deity, often presented as the wife of Kuarahy, the Sun is realized, alas, the repetition of a holy woman ties with the "center of the earth." For some Guarani groups, it is Ñandecy, for others it is Jasuká. But this has an explanation: Jasuká would be a feminine symbol, says Candida Graciela Chamorro Arguello in the article "The rite of naming a village mbyá-Guarani Paraná", published in the journal Diáloigos, Universidade Estadual de Maringa - PR. "Jasuká is the sacred name of women and bat pace by them used in religious ceremonies. It is also the name of a female deity, the Great Parent of the universe, from whose breasts would have nourished the creator of the world. "

There is, however, a further understanding of Jasuká, which leads to a relationship with Peabiru. Well apart from proper name of a goddess, the word jasuká can also be a common noun, but with religious connotation, say some scholars. Would be synonymous with "great primordial fog", "fog that is the origin of life," according to the Paraguayan José Pertasso ethnographer. Graciela Chamorro says something equal in his article: "The origin of Jaxuká dates back to the origin of one of the elementary substances of nature: water. Therefore it is represented by dew, by the smoke, the fog, the rain and the sacred tree, cedar, talking and boiling your water for health and repair people. Therefore, the naming ceremony of Mbyá (when the deities give names to children), water and smoke are the most important symbols ".]]></description>

Wikipedia - El Fuerte de Samaipata (Fort Samaipata), also known simply as "El Fuerte", is an archaeological site and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Santa Cruz Department, Florida Province, Bolivia.[1] It is situated in the eastern foothills of the Bolivian Andes and is a popular tourist destination for Bolivians and foreigners alike. It is served by the nearby town of Samaipata.


It is not actually a military fortification, but it is generally considered a pre-Columbian religious site, built by the Chané people, a pre-Inca culture of Arawak origin.[2] There are also ruins of an Inca city built near the temple; the city was built during the Inca expansion to the southeast. Both Incas and Chanes suffered several raids from Guarani warriors who invaded the region from time to time. Eventually, the Guarani warriors conquered the plains and valleys of Santa Cruz and destroyed Samaipata. The Guaranis dominated the region well into the Spanish colonial period.[2]]]></description>

From Santa Cruz, we headed to Samaipata, the meeting point of the Guarani and the Inca cultures, the meeting point of east and west in South America. At different times, this enormous heavily-carved sacred ceremonial rock was under the power of the Guarani and then an Inca outpost.]]></description>

The invading force had reached the towns of Presto and Tarabuco, only a few kilometers from Sucre, the official capital of Bolivia. Here, encountering heavy opposition in the form of twenty thousand trained Inca warriors rushed to the area, with bolas, slings, axes and clubs, Garcia retired to the Chaco to gather
reinforcements and secure the large quantity of loot they had won. They had speared a hundred kilometers into the Inca empire and spirited off a vast collection of gold and silver objects, rich clothing and a goodly number of slaves.]]></description>

Potosí lies at the foot of the Cerro de Potosí[3]—sometimes referred to as the Cerro Rico("rich mountain")—a mountain popularly conceived of as being "made of" silver ore, which has always dominated the city. The Cerro Rico is the reason for Potosí's historical importance, since it was the major supply of silver for Spain during the period of the New World Spanish Empire.]]></description>

Garcia looted an impressive booty of silver. When the army of Huayna Cápac arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near San Pedro on the Paraguay River.


The Indians, however, spared the life of his son, who was the first Paraguayan mestizo. News of this excursion into Incan territory later distracted Sebastian Cabot from his expedition to the East Indies (which could have resulted in the second circumnavigation of the globe after Ferdinand Magellan) causing him to imprison or maroon his lieutenants and remain in the Rio de la Plata region for several years.]]></description>

Meanwhile, a ship had arrived at Santa Catarina. The San Gabriel, commanded by Rodrigo de Acuna, deserted the fleet of Garcia Jofre de Loaisa which was following Magellan's route to the Spice Islands. Acuna put in at Puerto de los Patos. There he met Ramirez and Montes, was shown the Bolivian treasure, and from there on things become tantalizingly vague. First, most of the silver was lost in an unspecified accident while being transferred to the ship. It plunged to the bottom of the bay opposite the bustling modern day city of Florianopolis. Then relations between Acuna and the castaways soured. A lively fight ensued, with a large number of Indians supporting Ramirez and Montes. Acuna never mentions the incident in his report to the king, but it seems safe to assume that he tried to take the spoils by force of arms.]]></description>
