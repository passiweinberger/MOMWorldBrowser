Single Bat with MERS Virus Discovered Near Original Outbreak Site  
 
While other animals, including the camel, have been fingered as possible carriers, none of the viruses isolated from these animals were a complete match with those extracted from infected people. But the MERS harbored by the Egyptian tomb bat proved to be a 100% match, say researchers from Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, EcoHealth Alliance and the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who announced their findings in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.                                                                                                                               (http://topics.time.com/animals/)]]></description>

MERS Outbreak May Be Infecting Camels; Experts Find Possible Source Of Deadly Virus

Researchers believe they have identified the source of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak: one-humped camels that are used in Saudi Arabia for meat, milk, transportation, and racing. The preliminary study revealed test results that confirmed a virus, similar to MERS, is circulating in the animals. The virus is either MERS or a similar respiratory case, bringing researchers one step closer to identifying the route of MERS' initial spread.]]></description>

Researchers found that viruses from infected humans and Arabian camels from the same geographical region have nearly identical DNA sequences.

"This indicates transmission between animals and man, a process referred to as zoonosis," said Norbert Nowotny of the Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine in Austria.

Virus levels were surprisingly high in the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva of the camels tested and scientists presume that contact with the mucosa is what transmits the disease to humans.

Now, a team from the University of Maryland andbiopharmaceutical company Novavax says its vaccine candidate has successfully induced neutralising antibodies that effectively block the virus from infecting cells in mice.

Vaccine development is typically very slow, and two papers were only just published identifying a few natural human antibodies that could serve as a basis for new vaccine models targeting Mers. However, Novavax has developed a technique it believes has the potential to be the undoing -- if pursued -- of coronaviruses likes Mers and Sars. They achieve this by building a vaccine containing nanoparticles that mimic the virus structure. 

"Both Sars-Cov and Mers-Cov contain a major surface spike protein," Gale Smith, vice president of vaccine development, told Wired.co.uk. In a coronavirus, these S proteins spark the production of neutralising antibodies in the body and also help the virus bind to target cells. If we could induce those antibodies prior to infection, we could theoretically create protection from the coronavirus.]]></description>

ABSTRACT In April 2012, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness occurred in a public hospital in Zarqa city, in Jordan; 8 health care workers were among the 11 people affected, 1 of who later died. The cause of the outbreak was 
unknown at the time and an epidemiological investigation including laboratory testing carried out immediately after the outbreak was inconclusive. Following the discovery of novel coronavirus infection (nCoV) in the Arabian peninsula in September 2012, stored respiratory and serum samples of patients from this outbreak were retested and the diagnosis of nCoV was confirmed in 2 deceased patients. This paper describes the epidemiological findings of retrospective investigation carried out in November 2012 and highlights the likelihood of nosocomial transmission of nCoV infection in a health-care setting. A total of 2 laboratory-confirmed and 11 probable cases were identified from this outbreak of whom 10 were HCWs and 2 were family members of cases.]]></description>

The German media and Saudi Arabia's health ministry have reported two new novel coronavirus (NCoV) cases, one in a patient hospitalized in Munich and the other a mild illness in a Saudi Arabian resident. According to an early report today in German from Abendzeitung, a news source based in Munich, the German patient arrived in Germany from the Middle East by medical transport. It says the patient is in isolation in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Munich Municipal Hospital. The patient is a 73-year-old man from the United Arab Emirates who was first treated in an Abu Dhabi hospital on Mar 19, another German news source, TZ Online, reported today. It said medical authorities are monitoring about 50 people who had contact with the patient. The case appears to be Germany's second NCoV case. In October a Qatari man was hospitalized and treated in Germany but has since recovered. The man's NCoV infection wasn't detected until almost a month after he was hospitalized, and so far no evidence of infection has been found in any of that case-patient's German contacts.]]></description>

He was still in that room on April 8, which was the day on which fever developed in Patient A. Fever developed in Patient C 3 days later. He underwent dialysis in the hospital's outpatient hemodialysis unit twice after the onset of symptoms — on April 11 and April 13.                                                                                                 
Between April 14 and April 30, MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in nine additional patients, who were undergoing hemodialysis in Hospital A (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Six of these patients (Patients D, E, F, G, H, and I) underwent hemodialysis at times that overlapped with the times Patient C was undergoing hemodialysis on either April 11 or April 13; three of them underwent the procedure in beds adjacent to Patient C's bed. Two patients (Patients K and P) underwent hemodialysis at times that overlapped with the times Patient F was undergoing hemodialysis after the onset of his symptoms, and one patient (Patient L) underwent hemodialysis in a bed adjacent to symptomatic Patient E. Eight additional probable cases occurred among patients undergoing hemodialysis between April 15 and April 30. There were no links between individual dialysis nurses or machines and case patients.]]></description>

Hospital Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus                                                    
Patient Q, who became infected with MERS-CoV in the ICU of Hospital A, had been undergoing long-term hemodialysis at an outpatient clinic in Hospital C and underwent hemodialysis in that unit while he was symptomatic. MERS-CoV infection developed in two additional patients (Patients T and W) at Hospital C. Patient T regularly traveled from home to the dialysis unit with Patient Q. Patient W underwent hemodialysis in the same 13-bed room and during the same shift as Patient Q.                                                                 
Eight patients (Patients B, E, F, G, H, I, K, and L) with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were transferred to Hospital D between April 18 and April 27. MERS-CoV infection developed in two patients (Patients X and Y) who were hospitalized on the same ward as Patient G and in a physician (Patient V) who cared for Patient K. Overall, two laboratory-confirmed cases occurred among more than 200 health care worker contacts who were followed after exposure. ]]></description>

But the World Health Organisation (WHO) says NCoV and Sars are distinct from each other.

It appears likely that the virus can be passed between people in close contact, it adds.

The Tunisian man, a diabetic, had been complaining of breathing problems since he returned from Saudi Arabia and he died in hospital in the coastal city of Monastir, AFP news agency reports.
Two of his children also contracted the virus, but had responded to treatment, the health ministry said, in a statement.]]></description>

A man with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome may have exposed 100 people to the deadly MERS virus at two Florida hospitals, health officials said today.
The 44-year-old man, who works as a healthcare provider in Saudi Arabia, was admitted to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando May 8, a week after developing symptoms of MERS mid-flight from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to London.
The man, whose name and nationality have not been released, traveled through Boston and Atlanta before arriving in Orlando, where he was visiting family, officials said.
The agency would not identify the man, but said he is a resident of Saudi Arabia, not an American. He was a health care worker in Saudi Arabia, which has been the center of the outbreak, and is now in an Orlando Hospital.

The person traveled to the USA from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on May 1, to visit family in Orlando, traveling through London, Boston and Atlanta on the way. All the passengers on the U.S. legs of the patient's journey are being notified today to look for possible symptoms of the virus, though the risk of transmission is considered very slight.

At least 20 hospital workers who were in contact with the man at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and Orlando Regional Medical Center have been placed in home isolation for the virus’s 14-day incubation period and are awaiting MERS test results.
One hospital worker, who developed symptoms of the virus 24 hours after being exposed, has been placed in isolation at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, Dr. Antonio Crespo said at a media briefing today.]]></description>

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia, which is grappling to contain the spread of a frequently deadly respiratory virus, announced Tuesday that a review of the illness led authorities to sharply revise upward the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the disease.
 
The surprise disclosure followed the unexpected firing of the kingdom's deputy health minister, heightening concerns about the country's ability to halt the spread of the Middle Eastern respiratory virus. He was the second senior Saudi health official to lose his job in less than two months.

A report by the official Saudi Press Agency said authorities have registered a total of 688 confirmed infections and 282 deaths as a result of MERS since the virus was first identified in 2012. Of those infected, 53 were reported to still be receiving treatment.

The Saudi Health Ministry's most recent tally of cases listed 575 cases and 190 deaths, meaning that over 100 cases had previously gone unreported.]]></description>
