Thus, the data shows your chances of surviving may depend greatly on the state in which you live.

			<ExtendedData>

			<description><![CDATA[On 11/29/2012, The Centers for Disease Control suddenly revised the complexity of how it classified Meningitis cases. 
(http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-map.html) 
 
"CDC continues to receive reports of patients presenting with paraspinal/spinal infections (e.g., epidural abscess, phlegmon, discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, or arachnoiditis at or near the site of injection). These syndromes have occurred in patients with and without evidence of fungal meningitis.                                                                                  
Because these infections are distinct from meningitis and joint infections, CDC will report case counts, as below, to better describe types of infections being identified in patients exposed to a preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injection, with preservative-free MPA that definitely or likely came from one of the following three lots produced by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) [05212012@68, 06292012@26, 08102012@51]."                                            
"* Some patients with meningitis had other infections diagnosed in addition; to date, all of these other infections have been paraspinal/spinal infections. The patient reported to have a peripheral joint infection and a spinal/paraspinal infection had both a joint injection and a spinal/paraspinal injection."


The CDC now classifies cases as follows:
 
A Total Case Count* of which there are the following classifications:

- Meningitis cases (with or without other infection)*. 
- Cases of Stroke without Lumbar Puncture only.
- Cases of Paraspinal/Spinal Infection only.
- Cases of Peripheral Joint Infection only.
- Cases of Paraspinal/Spinal + Peripheral Joint Infection 
- Deaths,                                                                                        
Note: Over the course of this accounting, many cases have jumped from one category to another.]]></description>

			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[According to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/fungal.html). 

"Fungal meningitis is not contagious, which means it is NOT transmitted from person to person. Fungal meningitis occurs when the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord are infected with a fungus. Fungal meningitis can develop after a fungus spreads through the bloodstream from somewhere else in the body, as a result of the fungus being introduced directly into the central nervous system, or by direct extension from an infected body site next to the central nervous system. Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms of other forms of meningitis, however they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms, like headache, fever, nausea, and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness, and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms."]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[latimes.com (http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-meningitis-settlement-20140507-story.html)
 
Victims of a fungal meningitis outbreak traced to a tainted steroid produced by a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy will be compensated from a $100-million fund created as part of the legal settlement stemming from the 2012 incident.

The settlement was filed this week in federal bankruptcy court and must be approved by Judge Henry Boroff. The agreement on the size of the fund was reached by the parties including owners of the pharmacy, the New England Compounding Center, and lawyers for the plaintiffs.

More than 750 people in 20 states – especially in Tennessee, Michigan and Indiana -- were sickened with fungal meningitis and related infections, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 64 deaths were reported.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The CDC appears to have stopped tracking this outbreak. The last CDC count was as of October 23, 2013. 
 (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-map.html) 

A Total of 751* cases in 20 states of which there are:

- 233 Meningitis cases
- 151 cases of Meningitis + Paraspinal/Spinal Infection only.
- 7 cases of Stroke without Lumbar Puncture only.
- 325 cases of Paraspinal/Spinal Infection Only
- 33 cases of Peripheral Joint Infection only.
- 2 cases of Paraspinal/Spinal + Peripheral Joint Infection
- 64 deaths,
The number of cases has been fairly consistent for now several months. Thus, I am going to stop tracking it as of November 3, 2013, my last edit of this map.

 -------------
According to the Huffington Post: "The number of cases has grown rapidly as health practitioners contacted some 13,000 people who received injections from a potentially tainted supply of steroid medication shipped to 23 states."
-------------


Case counts by state are based on the state where the procedure was performed, not the state of residence.]]></description>
