The cow version of the disease is called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/bse/), which according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is...

"BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. The nature of the transmissible agent is not well understood. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal protein known as prion protein. For reasons that are not yet understood, the normal prion protein changes into a pathogenic (harmful) form that then damages the central nervous system of cattle."]]></description>

How Now Mad Cow? (http://www.mad-cow.org/lacey.html)
by Professor Richard Lacey
 
By late 1994, the disease had been identified in nearly 150,000 animals and in just over half of all cattle herds in Britain. Some scientists including myself believe that the only way to tackle the problem would be to destroy all herds with cattle incubating the disease.

BSE has affected all breeds including, significantly, Jersey and Guernsey cattle on their respective islands. The black and white Friesian Holstein cows are the most commonly affected simply because there are far more of them in Britain than other breeds. The youngest case so far recorded of a cow showing the symptoms of BSE was 20 months and the oldest 18 years.]]></description>

300,000 Mad Cow Cases Undetected In France (http://rense.com/general54/30000.htm)

"We estimate that 301,200 cows in France were infected by BSE between 1980 and June 2000," conclude the authors of the report, Virginie Supervie and Dominique Costagliola. "There is uncertainty about estimates of the number of cases in the early 1980s, but the level of animals infected climbed between 1987 and 1990 and dropped from then until 1992.
 
"Furthermore, 47,300 animals at an advanced stage of the disease entered into the food chain before 1996, and 1,500 between July 1996 and June 2000." According to previous official figures there were just 103 confirmed cases of the disease between 1991 and 2000, during which period the government relied on farmers and veterinarians to report animals with BSE.
 
Since 2000, when controls were tightened, a further 820 cases have been confirmed, according to figures published last month, bringing the total to 923 over the past 13 years - a tiny fraction of the total estimated in the new report.]]></description>

While the strain has been found in only two Italian cows, both apparently healthy, scientists in Europe and the United States said it should provide new impetus in Washington for the Department of Agriculture to adopt the more sensitive rapid tests used in Europe because it may not show up in those used in the United States.]]></description>

			<name>6/3/2014 - 4th Confirmed U.S. Death from Mad Cow Disease in Texas</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[modernfarmer.com/

This disease, often fatal, is believed to be caused by the consumption of products made from cows with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease. Typically, vCJD is passed to humans through ingesting the brain, spinal cord or digestive tract of an infected animal, though the disease can be found throughout the body of an afflicted cow. It is generally suspected to be transmitted through meat consumption more than dairy, according to James Cullor, director of the UC Davis Dairy Food Safety Laboratory. It is believed that animals contract BSE from consuming the animal feed made from the parts of other cows.

Like the previous three cases found in the U.S., the Texas patient is believed to have gotten the disease from travel overseas, specifically in Great Britain and the Middle East. According to the Texas Department of State Health website, “there are no public health concerns or threats associated with this case.” Meanwhile, the CDC continues to investigate.]]></description>
