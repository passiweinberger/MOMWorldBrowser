 Orange: Photovoltaic Power Stations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_power#Photovoltaic_power_systems)

Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: the most developed are the parabolic trough [discuss], the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.[3] Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24 hour electricity generation.[4]

A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.]]></description>

Alvarado I is a large solar thermal power station in Alvarado, in Extremadura, Spain. Construction on the plant commenced in December 2007 and was completed in July 2009, when commercial operations began. With an installed capacity of 50 MWe,[1] it is one of the largest solar thermal power stations in the world.[2][3]

The facility is built on a 1 km2 (0.4 sq mi) site with a solar resource of 2,174 KW·h/m3/year, producing an estimated 105,200 MW·h of electricity per year (an average power of 12 MW). The plant uses parabolic trough technology, and is made up of 768 solar thermal collectors, with an output temperature of 393 °C (739 °F), transferred with Biphenyl and Diphenyl oxide heat transfer agents.[1]                                                                                  
A second 50 MWe facility, Alvarado II, is currently on the proposal stage. It is planned to be constructed in the same area as Alvarado I.[2]]]></description>

Andasol is the first parabolic trough power plant in Europe, and Andasol 1 went online in March 2009. Because of the high altitude (1,100 m) and the semi-arid climate, the site has exceptionally high annual direct insolation of 2,200 kWh/m² per year.[3] Each plant has a gross electricity output of 50 megawatts (MWe), producing around 165 gigawatt-hours (GW·h) per year (21 MW·yr per year). The collectors installed have a combined surface area of 51 hectares (equal to 70 soccer fields); it occupies about 200 ha of land.[3]]]></description>

The Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station is a hybrid power station near Hassi R'Mel in Algeria. The plant combines a 25 MW parabolic trough concentrating solar power array, covering an area of over 180,000 m2, in conjunction with a 130 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant, so cutting carbon emissions compared to a traditional power station.[1] The output from the solar array will be used in the steam turbine.

The construction contract was signed on January 5, 2007[1] and the plant is to be developed by New Energy Algeria (NEAL),[2] a joint venture between Sonatrach Sonelgaz and SIM.

The station began producing electricity in June 2011. It was inaugurated July 14, 2011.[3]]]></description>

The ISCC plant is part of Martin Plant site which consists of 5 units. Unit 1 & Unit 2 are 800 MW steam electric generating units that use natural gas and low-sulfur residual oil. Unit 3 & Unit 4 are 500 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle units. Unit 8 is a natural gas fired 4-on-1 combined cycle unit with a nominal capacity of 1150 MW. Light oil is used as backup. Unit 8, placed into commercial operation in 2005, is integrated with the solar plant. Unit 8 features four 170 MW gas turbines, one 470 MW steam turbine, and a single condenser and cooling tower[1] .[2] The single solar field circuit heats 4 steam generators, after each gas turbine. The Martin solar thermal facility is designed to provide steam for FPL's existing Martin Unit 8 combined cycle unit, thus reducing FPL's use of natural gas. No additional capacity (MW) will result from the operation of the solar thermal facility. The Solar Energy Center has an array of approximately 190,000-mirrorparabolic troughs on about 500 acres (202 ha) of the Martin County plant.[3] The solar collectors feed heat to the existing steam plant, generating electricity at a rate of 155,000 MW·h per year.[4] The 2012 solar derived production was about 89,000 MW·h of power, according to records filed with the state’s Public Service Commission. That’s 42% less than what was projected when the plant got approval.[5]Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project.[6] Construction began in 2008[7] and was completed by the end of 2010.[8]]]></description>

Pobeda Solar Park is a 50.6 MW photovoltaic (PV) plant in Pobeda, in the Pleven Province of Northern Bulgaria.
 
The power plant is monitored from a control center in Sofia, along with three other photovoltaic power plants totaling 85 MW, expected to produce a combined total of 95 GWh/year.[1][2][3]
 
This projects was funded through the E.U and is one more step that Bulgaria is making to modernize and join their fellow E.U. contries with efforts to expand clean energy.

On July 2, 2012 the control module and transformer were damaged by a rocket-propelled grenade, shortly before the power plant was connected to the grid.[4]]]></description>

The PS10 Solar Power Plant (Spanish: Planta Solar 10), is the world's first commercial concentrating solar power tower operating near Seville, in Andalusia, Spain. The 11 megawatt (MW) solar power tower produces electricity with 624 large movable mirrors called heliostats.[2] It took four years to build and so far cost €35 million (US$46 million).[3] PS10 produces about 23,400 megawatt-hours (MW·h) per year, for which it receives €271 (US$360) per MW·h under its power purchase agreement, equating to a revenue of €6.3 million per year.[4]]]></description>

In 1995 Solar One was converted into Solar Two, by adding a second ring of 108 larger 95 m² (1,000 ft²) heliostats around the existing Solar One, totaling 1926 heliostats with a total area of 82,750 m² (891,000 ft²). This gave Solar Two the ability to produce 10 megawatts—enough to power an estimated 7,500 homes.[1]Solar Two used molten salt, a combination of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate, as an energy storage medium instead of oil or water as with Solar One. This helped in energy storage during brief interruptions in sunlight due to clouds.[1] The molten salt also allowed the energy to be stored in large tanks for future use such as night time—Solar Two had sufficient capacity to continue running for up to three hours after the sun had set. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into an Air Cherenkov Telescope in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere. Its name is now C.A.C.T.U.S..[2] Solar Two's 3 primary participants were Southern California Edison (SCE), the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

On November 25, 2009, after 10 years of not producing any energy, the Solar Two tower was demolished.[1] The mothballed site was levelled and returned to vacant land by Southern California Edison. All heliostats and other hardware were removed.]]></description>

The power station consists of two adjacent plants, Valle 1 and Valle 2. Each one has a nameplate capacity of 50 MW, using SENER parabolic trough collectors creating solar fields of 510,120 square metres on a total surface area of 460 hectares.[2] Net electrical output for each section is expected to be 160 gigawatt-hours (GW·h) per year. Each plant will have a molten salt thermal storage system containing 28,500 tons of molten salt (60% sodium nitrate / 40% potassium nitrate),[1] capable of storing enough heat to generate 750 MW(e)·h of electricity — enough to operate at full power for 7.5 hours without sunshine.[3]]]></description>
