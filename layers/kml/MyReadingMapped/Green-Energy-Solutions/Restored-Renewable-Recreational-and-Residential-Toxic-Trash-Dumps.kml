The Fresh Kills landfill, a 2200-acre dump site for the city’s garbage, was closed in March 2001, although a portion of it was re-opened to accept debris and human remains from the Twin Towers collapse of September 2001. Now it is being returned to nature. The City of New York Department of Sanitation has capped the landfill and planted sumac, shadblow, hackberry, blueberry, blackberry, and beach plum—eighteen species of native shrubs and trees in all. These woody plants were chosen to replicate the scrub forest once found here and still present on parts of Long Island and coastal New Jersey. In time, it will be a 2200-acre park of scrub-type coastal woodland, meadows, and salt marshes.]]></description>

A recycling facility operated by the Israeli company ArrowEcology has introduced a new technology known as ArrowBio [12] that separates recyclable materials using water technology. Eighty percent of the waste that enters the system is reused, while only 20 percent ends up in the landfill.[13]

Plans were subsequently drawn up to remediate the site and use the mountain and surrounding land as the centerpiece of Ariel Sharon Park .[14] A 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) area was demarcated for the park during the term of Ariel Sharon, who was an avid supporter of the project.[15] The planner is landscape architect and urban planner Peter Latz.[15] The park was later named for Sharon. Latz has invented a technique to protect future flowers and fruits from contaminants: The landscape is being covered with a “bioplastic” layer that blocks methane, topped with layers of gravel and a meter of clean soil.[16]

The park is currently under construction. When complete, it will be three times the size of New York's Central Park, and will introduce many new ecological technologies. A 50,000-seat amphitheater will also be built there.[17]]]></description>

Limited municipal funding was available for closure. In addition to the landfill closure process itself, several other issues required attention including preventing contamination of nearby private potable wells and the protection of an existing endangered species habitat at the site. The county considered three closure options having estimated capital costs ranging from $4.3 million to $7.4 million and annual 
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs ranging from $150,000 to $260,000. A feasibility study was conducted, and the county selected a landfill closure option that included a groundwater recovery and treatment system, a design for habitat protection 
and a municipal golf course as a revenue generator.

The Gunn Highway Landfill is located off Gunn Highway in Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida. The county operated the landfill as a trench-type facility for the disposal of MSW from 1958 to 1962. The landfill disposal areas occupied approximately fifteen acres. After the landfill was closed, the property was subdivided and developed. A total of thirteen apartment buildings and a clubhouse were constructed over the waste-filled  areas of the landfill.

The Hampshire Homes Landfill was located in the City of Miramar, Broward County, Florida. This site received primarily construction debris wastes from all the homes that were built as part of a very large subdivision project known as the Hampshire Homes Subdivision. The parcel where the landfill was located had the lowest elevation in the subdivision and was planned for use as a dry detention area for stormwater. 

Construction debris from the subdivision was used as fill to prepare the bottom elevation of the dry detention area. Reportedly, other non-construction debris wastes managed to find their way into the landfill as well at night and on the weekends. When the  subdivision project was nearly completed, the construction debris wastes were graded, covered with two feet of soil and then covered with sod. Then twenty additional homes were constructed around the perimeter of the waste disposal area. Upon completion of 
the subdivision, the common backyard shared by these twenty residences became an attractive playground for the many children living in the homes.]]></description>

Easthampton is a model small city of the 21st century, fostering innovation with a mill-town soul. As one of the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) designated Green Communities, Easthampton has taken great strides towards becoming a clean energy leader in Massachusetts, and with their solar installation, one of the largest and first of its kind in the state, the city is taking advantage of an otherwise unusable landfill resource to add revenue to the municipality’s general fund.]]></description>
