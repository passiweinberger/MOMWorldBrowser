			<description><![CDATA[This map by Seth Kadish displays data on solid waste management by country. The data was published in 2012, and is based on municipal solid waste (MSW) from urban populations only. Countries where data are not available are black.

The map shows garbage generation by weight (in kilograms) per capita per day. The median of the 161 reporting countries is 1.13 kg/person/day. Fourteen countries exceed a value of 3 kg/person/day, six of which generate more than 5 kg/person/day. Six of the top eight garbage generators are Caribbean countries.

			<description><![CDATA[As a former city common councilman for a small northeast city of 79,000, I was involved in evaluating the construction of a regional Waste-to-Energy facility in a heavily populated area due to the anticipated closing of the landfill we participated in. With the guidance of our citizens, and the surrounding 20 communities, we decided to participate in a larger regional facility being considered even though it would require building recycling transfer stations and trucking our reduced waste to the Waste-to-Energy facility twenty miles away. Far enough away to not be a blight in our communities, but still close enough to be an airborne health hazard. Such is the price of the stuff we throw away. The Waste-to-Energy facility that was built was the Wheelabrator designed, built and operated facility in Bridgeport, CT, where blight was already a problem all us surrounding communities adding to and blight we end up paying for in our taxes. The facility processes 2,250 tons per day of municipal waste and generates 67,000 kilowatts of power.]]></description>

Analysis of the Economics of Waste-to-Energy Plants in China by Ling Qiu (http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/Qiu_thesis.pdf)
 
In a period of less than twenty years, China has become a major actor in the implementation of 
waste-to-energy technologies for managing municipal solid wastes (MSW); at the present time, an estimated 15% (23 million tons of MSW) are processed in over 100 WTE plants. China is also an exception to the general rule that nations with relatively low GDP per capita rely exclusively 
on landfilling. The objective of the first part of this thesis was to examine the technical, policy, 
and economic factors that have contributed to this rapid expansion of WTE capacity in China 
and the business models used. The study concentrated on large cities in China, in particular 
Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.]]></description>

- Of the 140 waste to energy and incinerators operating in 2000, the private sector owned 50 percent (70 facilities).                                                             
- By privatizing solid waste operations, cities typically save between 20 and 45 percent on their total cost for waste disposal. A 1995 survey of 120 cities, counties, and special districts in 33 states by the Mercer Group, Inc., an Atlanta-based management consulting firm, found that 100 percent of participants saved money.]]></description>

MacArthur Waste-to-Energy facility, operating as Covanta MacArthur, began commercial operations in March 1990 under an agreement with the Islip Resource Recovery Agency. The facility processes 485 tons per day of municipal solid waste, generating up to 12 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity, or enough to power 12,000 Long Island homes. The facility has been designated a Volunteer Protection Programs (VPP) Star facility by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the facility's environmental management system has been awarded ISO-14001 certification, a recognized environmental management system standard. The facility recovers and recycles 5,500 tons of ferrous (steel) metals annually.]]></description>

Operating as Covanta Tulsa Renewable Energy, LLC, the facility processes 1,125 tons-per-day of solid waste, generating up to 240,000 pounds-per-hour of steam. The steam can be used to power a turbine generator to produce 16.8 megawatts of clean, renewable energy that is sold to Public Service Company of Oklahoma. However, on a more regular basis, the steam is sold to Holly Frontier, Inc. (an independent refiner), adjacent to the facility, and used in the refining process. This offsets the need for the refinery to use fossil fuels to generate their own steam.]]></description>

The facility operates as Covanta Marion and processes 550 tons per day of municipal solid waste (MSW), which generates up to 13.1 megawatts of renewable energy sold to Portland General Electric. The facility was the first mass-burn waterwall resource recovery facility combusting MSW in the United States to use dry flue gas scrubbers and fabric filter baghouses to control acid gases and particulates. In addition to MSW, the facility processes about 250 tons-per-month of supplemental waste including non-hazardous medical waste. It is located in Brooks, a small farming community about four miles north of Salem, the state capital, and 40 miles south of Portland.]]></description>
