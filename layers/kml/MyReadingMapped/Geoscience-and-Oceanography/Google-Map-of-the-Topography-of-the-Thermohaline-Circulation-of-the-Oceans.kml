This  line density map, by Seth Kadish, is of all tropical cyclone (hurricane/typhoon) tracks since 1970. The blue areas have had no tropical cyclones, while the red areas have had at least 30. The cell size for the map is about six miles, and the search radius is ~30 miles.  Although the scale peaks at 30, the highest densities on the map are just under 80! (A density of 80 means that, on average, the location came within 30 miles of two tropical cyclone epicenters every year for the past ~40 years.)

			<description><![CDATA[scientificamerican.com (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/atlantic-current-strength-declines/)

The marked slowdown in the past decade of the warm Atlantic Ocean currents that bring mild weather to northwestern Europe may be caused by natural variation and not anthropogenic climate change, as has been previously suggested.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is part of the great ocean ‘conveyor belt’ that ceaselessly circulates sea water, heat and nutrients around the globe. In particular, it transports large amounts of warm water from the tropics to the poles, warming the British Isles and maritime northern Europe along the way (see ‘Current affair’). But since 2004, ocean sensors have detected a significant decline in the strength of the currents and a cooling of the subtropical Atlantic as a result. From mid-2009 to mid-2010, for example, the circulation slowed to two-thirds of its usual strength — and some oceanographers suggested that the drop caused the harsh weather in the United Kingdom and western Europe that winter (see Nature 497, 167–168; 2013).]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_Circulation#Effects_on_global_climate)

The thermohaline circulation plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in regulating the amount of sea ice in these regions, although poleward heat transport outside the tropics is considerably larger in the atmosphere than in the ocean.[14] Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on the Earth's radiation budget. Insofar as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters are exposed to the surface, it may also play an important role in determining the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While it is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that Western Europe is so temperate, it has been suggested that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because of the effect of atmospheric waves bringing warm air north from the subtropics.[15] However, the underlying assumptions of this particular analysis have likewise been challenged.[16]

Large influxes of low-density meltwater from Lake Agassiz and deglaciation in North America are thought to have led to a disruption of deep water formation and subsidence in the extreme North Atlantic and caused the climate period in Europe known as the Younger Dryas.[17]]]></description>

In a new study in the Journal of Climate, Zhang finds both strengthening and converging winds around the South Pole can explain 80 percent of the increase in ice volume which has been observed.

“The polar vortex that swirls around the South Pole is not just stronger than it was when satellite records began in the 1970s, it has more convergence, meaning it shoves the sea ice together to cause ridging,” the study’s press release explains. “Stronger winds also drive ice faster, which leads to still more deformation and ridging. This creates thicker, longer-lasting ice, while exposing surrounding water and thin ice to the blistering cold winds that cause more ice growth.”]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We all enjoy the benefits of those thermoplastic food containers that greatly affect heat transfer. Now consider that the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have France-sized Plastic Garbage Patches that affect the heat transfer between the sea, the sun and the air. Those polystyrene particles have a heat transfer coefficient of 0.03k, which is a lot lower than the heat transfer rate of water at 0.58k, or ice at 2.18k. So, what effect does having a large and growing amount of thermoplastics in our oceans have on our climate if it changes the volume of heat transferred between the air and the sea?

Keep in mind that these thermoplastic particles are mixed in the sea water at a very critical location in the Thermohaline Circulation where both the Deep Current and the Surface Current pass.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation#Bryden_measurements_reported_late_2005)

On 19 January 2006, a News Feature Climate change: A sea change by Quirin Schiermeier appeared in Nature, detailing reactions to the Bryden results.[18] Points made by Schiermeier include the following:

- The results are a surprise to scientists in the field.
- Modelling suggests that increase of fresh water flows large enough to shut down the thermohaline circulation would be an order of magnitude greater than currently estimated to be occurring, and such increases are unlikely to become critical within the next hundred years; this is hard to reconcile with the Bryden measurements.
- The Bryden results could be caused by natural variation, or "noise", that is, coincidence.
- If the results are correct, perhaps thermohaline circulation reductions will not have the drastic effects that have been predicted on European cooling.
- While previous shutdowns (e.g. the Younger Dryas) are thought by some scientists to have caused cooling, the current overall climate is believed to be different; in particular, sea-ice formation is hypothesized to be less because of overall global warming.
- However, a thermohaline circulation shutdown could have other major consequences apart from cooling of Europe, such as an increase in major floods and storms, a collapse of plankton stocks, warming or rainfall changes in the tropics or Alaska and Antarctica (including those from intensified El Niño effect), more frequent and intense El Niño events, or an oceanic anoxic event (oxygen (O - 2) below surface levels of the stagnant oceans becomes completely depleted — a probable cause of past mass extinction events).]]></description>

 (http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/04/10/1200602/-The-Antarctic-Half-of-the-Global-Thermohaline-Circulation-Is-Faltering#)                                               
The sudden cooling of Europe, triggered by collapse of the global thermohaline circulation in the north Atlantic and the slowing of the Gulf Stream has been popularized by the movies and the media. The southern half of the global thermohaline circulation is as important to global climate but has not been popularized. The global oceans' coldest water, Antarctic bottom water forms in several key spots around Antarctica. The water is so cold and dense that it spreads out along the bottom all of the major ocean basins except the north Atlantic and Arctic. Multiple recent reports provide strong evidence that the formation of Antarctic bottom water has slowed dramatically in response to massive subsurface melting of ice shelves and glaciers. The meltwater is freshening a layer of water found between depths of 50 and 150 meters. This lightened layer is impeding the formation of Antarctic bottom water, causing the Antarctic half of the global thermohaline circulation to falter.]]></description>

In contrast to the melting of the Arctic sea ice, sea ice around Antarctica has expanded in recent years.[3] The reasons for this are not fully understood, but suggestions include the climatic effects on ocean and atmospheric circulation of the ozone hole,[3] and/or cooler ocean surface temperatures as the warming deep waters melt the ice shelves.[4]]]></description>

Large-scale upwelling is also found in the Southern Ocean. Here, strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found in off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations (see coastal upwelling above).

Some models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.]]></description>

Explosive volcanic eruptions affect the global climate mainly through injecting sulfur bearing gases into the stratosphere, which oxidize to form sulfate aerosols. Stratospheric sulfur aerosols spread around the globe by the atmospheric circulation, producing surface cooling by scattering solar radiation back to space. This cooling effect on the ocean surface usually lasts for several years as the lifetime of sulfate aerosols is about 2–3 years.[1] However, in the subsurface ocean the cooling signal may persist for a longer time and may have impacts on some decadal variabilities, such as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).[1][2]]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age#Volcanic_activity)


Throughout the Little Ice Age, the world experienced heightened volcanic activity.[71] When a volcano erupts, its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole earth. This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation, leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption. Also emitted by eruptions is sulfur in the form of sulfur dioxide gas. When this gas reaches the stratosphere, it turns into sulfuric acid particles, which reflect the sun's rays, further reducing the amount of radiation reaching Earth's surface. The 1815 eruption of Tambora in Indonesia blanketed the atmosphere with ash; the following year, 1816, came to be known as the Year Without a Summer, when frost and snow were reported in June and July in both New England and Northern Europe. Other volcanoes that erupted during the era and may have contributed to the cooling include Billy Mitchell (ca. 1580), Mount Parker (1641), Long Island (Papua New Guinea) (ca. 1660), and Huaynaputina (1600).[19]]]></description>

Long-term (≈800-year) and short-term (≈20-year) estimates of the rate of deep water formation in the Southern Ocean are in serious disagreement. This disagreement suggests to me that the rate of deep water formation may have been larger during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than it is now.]]></description>

The Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array (RAPID/MOCHA) program is a collaborative research project between the National Oceanography Centre (Southampton, U.K.), the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) that measure the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and ocean heat transport in the North Atlantic Ocean.[1] This array was deployed in March 2004 to continuously monitor the MOC and ocean heat transport that are primarily associated with the Thermohaline Circulation across the basin at 26°N. The RAPID-MOCHA array is planned to be continued through 2014 to provide a decade or longer continuous time series.[2]

The continuous observations are measured by an array of instruments along 26°N. This monitoring array directly measures the transport of the Gulf Stream in the Florida Strait using an undersea cable and a moored array measures bottom pressure and water column density (including temperature and salinity) at the western and eastern boundary and on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).[3] Absolute transports including barotropic circulation are monitored using precision bottom pressure gauges.[4] "Dynamic height" moorings are used to estimate the spatially average geostropic velocity profile and associated transports over relatively wide mooring separations.[2] The dynamic height moorings requires measurements on both sides of the current field only, rather both the horizontal and vertical structure of the current field to be sufficiently well resolved to estimate transports.[5] The basin-wide MOC strength and vertical structure are estimated via Ekman transports by satellite scatterometer measurements and the geotrophic and direct current observations.[2]]]></description>

			<name>Impact of Brine Rejection</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_rejection)

Brine rejection is a process that occurs during sea ice formation where salt is pushed from forming ice into the surrounding seawater, creating saltier, denser brine.

Brine drainage has a controlling influence on the mechanical, biological and transport properties, and hence upon the ecology of the polar oceans.[8] The downwelling of denser, briny water from sea ice creation causes upwelling of deep bottom water, and helps initiate deep ocean currents, which helps to drive thermohaline circulation. Brine rejection is the dominant mechanism for formation of the deep and bottom waters in the Antarctic, and for formation of the densest part of the North Pacific intermediate water, and is a central process for changes in the water masses of the Arctic.[9]

According to some hypotheses, the salty water masses caused by brine rejection fill the deep ocean basins and lead to stratification, which locks considerable amounts of CO2 in the deep oceans.[10] Because these waters are able to contain a large amount of CO2, they have helped slow the process of climate change.

Climate change could have different effects on ice melt and brine rejection. Previous studies have suggested that as ice cover thins, it will become a weaker insulator, resulting in larger ice production during the autumn and winter. The consequent increase in winter brine rejection will drive ocean ventilation, and strengthen the inflow of warm Atlantic waters.[11] Studies of the last glacial maximum (LGM) have indicated that a drastic reduction in the production of sea ice and thus reduction of brine rejection, would result in the weakening of the stratification in the global deep oceans and in CO2 release into the shallow oceans and the atmosphere, triggering global deglaciation.[12]]]></description>

Salt is expelled as the ocean water freezes to form sea ice. This creates dense brine that sinks and flows down the continental shelf of Antarctica to form Antarctic Bottom Water – the densest water in the open ocean. This water flows outward from the Southern Ocean and through other ocean basins as part of the global ocean circulation ‘conveyor belt’ that distributes heat, nutrients and gases around the world. There are only a few areas in the world where this dense water is formed, an example being the Mertz Glacier Polynya to the south of Tasmania.]]></description>

			<name>Present Sea-Ice Extent</name>
			<ExtendedData>

			<description><![CDATA[ldeo.columbia.edu (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~louisab/sedpage/basics.html)

Sea-Ice exists today in the polar oceans, in both the northern and southern hemispheres.  The amount of sea-ice varies seasonally due to changes in the amount of incoming radiation, but this seasonality is expressed very differently in the northern and southern polar oceans.  The Arctic Ocean stays fairly ice-covered year round.  Only 10% of ice leaves each year, primarily due to geographical constraints imposed by the surrounding landmasses.  As a result, much of the pack ice in the center of the ocean can persist for 4-5 years, and reach up to 4 meters in thickness- ice near the edge is generally closer to 1 meter in thickness.  In contrast, the Southern Ocean’s sea ice is much more seasonal.  With no landmasses to prevent flow to the north, nearly all of Southern Ocean sea-ice flows north, melts and forms again each year.  Consequently, the latitude of northernmost sea-ice extent there varies by up to 20° over the course of a year. 
 Much of what we know about present sea-ice extent comes from satellite data.  There are a number of programs run through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).  Each of these programs has documented a decrease in the amount of sea-ice cover in both polar oceans during the last decade.  While the exact cause has yet to be identified, the importance of sea-ice in climate regulation means that this will certainly have implications for future climate.]]></description>
