In March, 2003, the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) published the Final Report of the Jersey Comparative Risk Project. [1] The project had spent four years studying environmental problems in New Jersey. The project steering committee was chaired by Daniel Rubenstein of Princeton University and by Sheryl Telford of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.
 
The Final Report includes Appendix 4 , a 369-page catalog of toxic exposures in New Jersey.[2] Here are  excerpts from the DEP's Appendix 4 (all page numbers inside parentheses refer to this appendix):]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[According to Science Daily's article Higher Levels of Several Toxic Metals Found in Children With Autism (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130225162231.htm) 

"In a recently published study in the journal Biological Trace Element Research, Arizona State University researchers report children with autism had higher levels of several toxic metals in their blood and urine compared to typical children." Which would explain the NJ.com article N.J. still ranks high in autism rate, report says, which reports "Autism rates continue to soar nationwide and New Jersey remains near the top of the list, with roughly 2 percent of children -- or about 1 in 50 -- diagnosed with the disorder, according to data the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released today."

Six underserved N.J. communities show higher rates of autism in young children, research finds (http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/six_underserved_nj_communities.html)

Roughly 1,000 children from Newark, Plainfield, Elizabeth, Trenton, New Brunswick and Bridgeton were screened. 

More than 30 – or 3 percent – were found to be on the autism spectrum. Most of them were late diagnoses; the average age of the children screened was just more than 4 years, while the current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend evaluations at 18 and 24 months. ]]></description>

Petroleum-related contamination at the site occurred when Exxon operated there. Contamination occurred due to leaks and discharges from petroleum storage tanks, on-site landfills, lagoons and sewer lines. Contamination originating from leaks in a trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform storage tank and releases in the processing area, is attributed to ICI operations at the site. Both soil and groundwater have been contaminated with volatile organic chemicals, such as xylene, benzene, chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and naphthalene. Contamination from metals includes, but is not limited to, arsenic, chromium, mercury, zinc, lead, nickel, manganese and cadmium.]]></description>

Sampling by EPA completed in March 2012 and combined with the results of a previous investigation revealed the presence of elevated levels of trichloroethene (TCE) in the ground water in the area of the former Alfred Heller Heat Treating facility. TCE was also found in elevated levels in soils on site property. TCE is a volatile organic compound and can emit vapors that may migrate through soils and into indoor air spaces of overlying buildings. Homes targeted for sampling have been determined to be at a low risk for vapor intrusion based on ground water sampling results.]]></description>

American Home Products Corporation is located on East Main Street in Bridgewater, New Jersey. The site is approximately 435 acres and has been used for numerous chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing operations for over 75 years. In 1994, American Home Products (AHP) Corporation purchased American Cyanamid Company, which previously owned the site. The plant was shut down in 1999 and demolition of the plant buildings was completed by November 2000. 

In 1982, the entire Cyanamid facility was listed on the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites. The site cleanup activities are being addressed under an EPA hazardous waste permit and a 1988 New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) order, which includes requirements to satisfy both the federal hazardous waste management program and Superfund. Pfizer Corporation has assumed full responsibilities for remediation of the site.]]></description>

EPA added the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey to the Superfund National Priorities List on September 8, 1983 because hazardous chemicals were found in the soil and ground water. The 575-acre superfund site has a history of industrial pollution dating back to 1915. For nearly 100 years, prior owners used the location for manufacturing chemicals and disposed of chemical sludge and other wastes on the property. The soil, ground water and waste disposal areas, called impoundments, are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-VOCs, metals, and other harmful chemicals. Some of these harmful chemicals are known to cause cancer in humans and animals or have other adverse effects on human health. The extent and nature of potential health effects depend on many factors, including the level and length of exposure.]]></description>

From 1933 to 1970, American Standard discharged wastewater contaminated with barium and trace amounts of other metals into a nearby canal leading to Bear Swamp. In 1970 the company stopped discharging into the canal, and instead began to discharge the wastewater into a series of settling basins - man-made pond-like structures in which materials heavier than water settle to the bottom.
 
Periodically, American Standard dredged the barium-contaminated clay from the bottom of the canal and the settling basins and left it on the ground nearby until it dried. The clay was then either left in piles or disposed-of in two unlined landfills at the American Standard facility. The clays of the canal and settling basins were the only areas of contamination resulting from past wastewater discharges; the groundwater below the facility has not been contaminated.]]></description>

The Asbestos Dump site consists of the 11-acre Millington site and three separate satellite sites. The Millington site lies in a residential and commercial area. Beginning in 1927, a succession of owners operated an asbestos products manufacturing plant at the Millington site. Asbestos was disposed of at the Millington site, comprising a large mound approximately 1.5 acres in size. Prior to remediation, erosion and weathering of the mound exposed areas of asbestos along the Passaic River bank. One satellite site, known as the Dietzman Tract or the Great Swamp area (operable unit 3), is approximately 7 acres and is located within the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, about 2 miles southeast of New Vernon Road. This site was used as a refuse and asbestos disposal area for approximately 40 years and is bordered by Great Brook and a woodland habitat. The New Vernon Road and White Bridge Road satellite sites are residential properties. The New Vernon Road site occupies approximately 30 acres. Broken asbestos tiles and siding, as well as loose asbestos fibers, were landfilled on this former corn and dairy farm during the late 1960's. The White Bridge Road site, covering 12 acres, is bounded by the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and private residences. This property was a farm until 1969, when the current owner started landfilling asbestos waste from the Millington facility. The wastes were present on the site as subsurface fill or as part of an asbestos waste mound. Disposal continued until 1975.]]></description>

The Atlantic Resources site includes contaminated soils on the property and the contaminated soils of the surrounding wetlands and the Raritan River. Surface water runoff from the site flows via two drainage-ways to the contaminated marsh to the west of the site. The marsh flows to the Raritan River, which is a human food chain fishery. 

EPA has removed drums containing hazardous waste to an off-site disposal area. Ash contaminated with dioxin and metals has been removed. In April 2001, EPA completed the demolition of buildings and other on-site structures. Responsible parties, under the direction of EPA are currently designing a remedy to excavate and remove contaminated surface soil and deeper soils that act as source material for ground water contamination. In 2008, EPA expects to choose a remedy to clean up contaminated sediments in the adjacent marsh and Raritan River. Under current conditions at this site, potential or actual human exposures are under control.]]></description>

The groundwater is contaminated with tetrachloroethene (PCE). Two sources are responsible for the contamination: a former leaking underground storage tank area that contained waste solvents and a firing range area, which was used as a dump site from 1960 to 1970. The firing range consisted of a primary lagoon, which received liquid waste and drums, and a circular lagoon, which received drums and oil-coated scrap. The PCE contamination of the groundwater has not decreased over time. The groundwater is limited to the site, and has not yet reached on-site surface water.]]></description>

A small recreational playground utilized by the Terrell Homes residents is located immediately adjacent the former Barth Smelting facility. 
 
At the end of March 2013, the EPA took soil samples at five different depths at 24 locations throughout the Terrell Homes complex. In addition, at six locations where bare soil was evident, surface soil samples were taken with an auger at depths between zero to one inch and one to six inches. At an asphalted area of the property, the EPA drilled holes in six locations of the asphalt and took samples at four different depths.
 
The results received in May 2013 indicate two locations near the community building of Terrell Homes with levels of lead in surface soil that significantly exceed the EPA residential soil screening level of 400 parts per million.]]></description>

The Chemical Insecticide Corporation (CIC) Site is located in Edison Township. CIC owned the property located at 30 Whitman Avenue from 1954 to 1970 and used it for processing various pesticides. In the mid-1960s, the Edison Department of Health became concerned about odors, wastewater discharges and on-site fires. The Department ordered the facility to stop discharging wastewater, oversaw disposal of leaking drums to eliminate an odor problem, and ordered the closing of on-site lagoons. CIC declared bankruptcy in 1970. Subsequently, Piscataway Associates bought the 6-acre CIC property and demolished the production facilities. As part of a State-wide dioxin screening program, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection sampled soil from the site and found contamination, triggering more detailed investigations by EPA. Approximately 77,000 people live within 3 miles of the site. There are no permanent surface water bodies on the CIC site. Surface water run-off drains toward the northeast corner of the site where it discharges into an underground conduit, which flows into an unnamed tributary of Mill Brook. The unnamed tributary and Mill Brook runs near the site and may have been used for recreation. The residents near these tributaries and the residents directly surrounding the site obtain potable water from a public water supply system located eight miles from the site. Groundwater underlying the site is considered by New Jersey to be a Class II-A, a source of potable water. No current exposures to contaminated groundwater are known. The nearest domestic potable water well used for drinking water is up-gradient to the southwest and approximately two miles from the site.limited physical exposure, but it also prevented uncontaminated groundwater from leaching through the contaminated soils; however contaminants do exist in the groundwater. Previously collected samples from the surface run-off indicated that it contained arsenic and the herbicide dinoseb. It was noted that this run-off eventually entered an unnamed tributary of Mill Brook, ultimately the contaminants would bind to the creek (tributary) sediments. The contaminated sediments were excavated and disposed of as part of Operable Unit 3 (OU3), resulting in the disposal of approximately 13,500 cubic yards of sediments. Additional comprehensive sampling and analysis of site soils revealed that they were contaminated with: arsenic; organic pesticides (e.g., DDT, chlordane); herbicides (dinoseb); and other hazardous substances. A remedial action (Operable Unit 2 - OU2) was selected to address the contaminated soils, ultimately resulting in the excavation of approximately 207,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the CIC site and surrounding impacted areas. Hazardous and non-hazardous soils were transported via railcars to the proper treatment and/or disposal facilities. As previously mentioned above, the groundwater at the site is contaminated with arsenic, organic pesticides and other hazardous substances. The site does not pose a threat to any existing potable water source since the limited mobility of the contaminated groundwater at the site minimizes the potential for off-site migration. Final groundwater actions (Operable Unit 4 - OU4) include a long-term groundwater monitoring program and the implementation of Institutional Controls (ICs) in and around the area of the former CIC site.]]></description>

After 1975, the lagoons were dealt with in different ways, including excavating the sludge that had settled in the lagoons and/or backfilling the lagoons with clean sand. In 1980 and 1981 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the ground water on the site as well as in private wells in neighboring areas. The ground water has been found to be contaminated with several VOCs including trichloroethene, benzene and vinyl chloride, and heavy metals including arsenic, chromium, and zinc. Due to this contamination, private wells near the CLTL facility have been closed and residences have been connected to a public water supply.]]></description>

Chevron has excavated some of the contaminated soils from the site and sent them off-site for proper disposal. They are continuing their investigation of the on- and off-site contamination. They installed a system in 1994 to pump the contaminated groundwater and to treat it. However, its operation was suspended in December 1999 for upgrade work following a control system failure. The system has not yet been placed back on line. Chevron continues to investigate groundwater contamination on- and off-site. Other treatment options are currently being evaluated.]]></description>

Clariant Corporation is located on a 13.55-acre on Fairlawn Avenue and Third Street, in the Borough of Fair Lawn, New Jersey, since 1945. It manufactures several products used by the textile and paper industries, including softeners, brighteners and dyes. Releases from one underground storage tank resulted in soil and groundwater contamination from volatile organic compounds such as orthodichlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene. The primary contaminant is orthodichlorobenzene and related compounds. The groundwater sampling data indicates that contamination may have migrated down to the bedrock.]]></description>

The 65 acre site located in Morris County was used as a sanitary municipal landfill between 1966 and 1978. Combe Fill Corporation (CFC) purchased the site in 1978. The following year, ground water beneath the site and in nearby residential wells was found to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air. Runoff flowed across the surface of the landfill and drained into the creeks that border the site. CFC went bankrupt in 1981, and the landfill was not properly closed. Approximately 10,000 people rely on ground water supplies from wells roughly two miles from the site.]]></description>

The site contains 65 acre of fill area that sits on a 115 acre plot of land in Morris County. The site was a municipal landfill from the 1940s until 1981. In 1978, Combe Fill Corporation (CFC) bought the landfill. While under CFC’s management, procedures at the landfill violated many of the New Jersey solid waste administrative codes. CFC went bankrupt in 1981, and the landfill was not properly closed.

A citizen’s group sampled the groundwater, surface water, and various liquids which flowed from the landfill and found them to be contaminated. Ground water beneath the site was contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate in the air.]]></description>

In 1982, several dozen one- to two-ounce glass vials containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were discovered on the site. Some of the vials were broken, but most were intact. The State requested that the property owners remove the vials, but the owners did not comply. The property was sold in 1983, and the new owners, under State supervision, removed the vials and excavated six inches of contaminated soil and placed the vials and soil in a federally approved hazardous waste facility. In 1986 and 1987, EPA conducted a remedial investigation of the site which included subsurface soil and groundwater sampling. The results of the investigation found no significant levels of any contaminants in the soils or groundwater. EPA deleted the Cooper Road Site from the NPL in 1989, when it was determined that the site no longer posed a threat to the public or the environment. New residential developments within the site area were placed on the municipal water service.]]></description>

Ground water testing near the site showed significant trichloroethene (TCE) contamination. Soil at the site is contaminated with volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, inorganic chemicals and PCBs, and fish from a nearby stream, Bound Brook, showed elevated levels of PCBs. This prompted the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to issue a fish consumption advisory warning people not to eat fish from Bound Brook and its tributaries.]]></description>

Groundwater is contaminated with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals including zinc, cadmium, copper, and lead. People who drink or are exposed to contaminated groundwater from the site may be at risk. The sediments and surface waters of Prickett's Pond and Prickett’s Brook (in the area near the site) are contaminated with zinc.

EPA (http://www.epa.gov/region02/waste/dupont_pompton/index.html)

Waste management practices during the facility’s operation resulted in contamination of surface water, soil and sediment, and ground water both on and off site. Wastes disposed of on site included lead salts, mercury compounds, explosive powders, chlorinated solvents, waste wire drawing solution and detonated blasting caps. Primary contaminants in the soil and sediments are lead and mercury. Ground water contaminants include volatile organic compounds which are potentially harmful contaminants that can cause vapor intrusion to indoor air. Lead and mercury releases have migrated off site resulting in soil contamination at 140 homes near Acid Brook, which were remediated. Contaminated ground water also migrated off site with the potential for vapor intrusion from contaminated ground water impacting off-site residences. ]]></description>

The 38 acre site in Atlantic County contained a landfill that operated from 1967 through 1979. Septic and sewage wastes were accepted and placed in ponds and lagoons. Reportedly, both solid and chemical wastes, including gas cylinders, drums filled with paint sludge, and household garbage were disposed of at the landfill.

Paint sludge inside the drums was found to contain elevated levels of lead and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are potentially harmful contaminants that easily evaporate into the air. Soils on site were found to contain significant levels of lead, cadmium, arsenic, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Groundwater sampling conducted in the aquifer beneath the site indicated the presence of several VOCs at levels that exceed federal drinking water standards. This poses a problem for the surrounding area because groundwater is the primary source of drinking water within 4 miles of the site. In addition, groundwater is used for irrigation of commercial food crops located near the site.]]></description>

High level of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was discovered in groundwater during the investigation of the Ethicon site in mid 1980s. The Needle Area has been identified as a historic source of PCE; this area was used to degrease wire with the solvent prior to processing. Significant quantities of PCE were used between 1972 and the early 1980s. Two 550-gallon above-ground storage tanks were used to store virgin and waste PCE from 1972 to 1980. Prior to and after that period, PCE was obtained and disposed of in 55-gallon drums. PCE use was discontinued at Ethicon in the mid-1980s.]]></description>

Site soils and groundwater were originally contaminated with a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including acetone, toluene, xylene and trichloroethylene; semi-volatile compounds (SVOCs), and some heavy metals, including arsenic, chromium and aluminum. EPA has determined that drinking contaminated Site groundwater could pose a public health threat. Site groundwater also poses a threat to the New Jersey Pinelands which is a sensitive ecosystem and a major groundwater recharge area. However, at present, only residual soils and groundwater contamination remain. No site contaminants have been detected in off-site groundwater, residential or public water supply wells. A fence was installed in 1988, to keep trespassers and children from becoming exposed to Site contaminants. There are two aquifers below the site that are linked, a shallow Cohansey aquifer and the deeper Kirkwood aquifer. Local groundwater flows in a southerly direction in both aquifers.]]></description>

Spills, releases from sewer lines, leaking pipes from underground tanks, discharges to surface water and the disposal of contaminated waste in an on-site landfill have resulted in the contamination of the Exxon site with petroleum products. Two lagoon areas that had been used for the disposal of hazardous waste are also sources of soil and groundwater contamination at the site.

The soil contamination caused by the sources listed above is consistent with the contamination sometimes found at other petroleum refineries, and includes metals and chemicals associated with petroleum such as the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) benzene and chlorobenzene. The groundwater that lies beneath the facility is also contaminated with benzene and chlorobenzene among other VOCs, and with arsenic.]]></description>

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), metals, and pesticides are present in groundwater above NJ maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). The Atlantic City municipal wells are not contaminated and likely to remain that way because they are isolated from the contaminated groundwater by an area-wide clay layer. The clay layer acts to prevent the migration of contaminated groundwater from the upper aquifers to the lower aquifer where the municipal wells draw their water.

The site, Westmoreland Well Field, which encompasses the three municipal wells and one additional well used as an observation well, is located in Bergen County. The site is located adjacent to Fair Lawn Industrial Park. 

Ground water at the Fair Lawn Well Field site is contaminated with semi-volatile organic compounds, contaminants that evaporate into the air easily. Ground water was initially and continues to be cleaned by pumping it into a pressurized vessel and then forcing a high pressure stream of air through the groundwater, causing the pollutants to evaporate.

Historically in Garfield, industrial facilities were located in close proximity to residential areas. These facilities included a tannery and chemical plant, and two electroplating companies. Some of these facilities used chromium in their processes, and it is suspected the ground water in the surrounding areas has become contaminated with chromium. In June 1993, chromium contaminated ground water and crystals were discovered in the basement of the Garfield Fire House #3. Since then, several other houses and business have had elevated levels of chromium in their basements due to ground water infiltration. EPA is continuing its ongoing site investigations to determine the potential sources, the extent of contamination, and levels of chromium.]]></description>

EPA added the Global Sanitary Landfill site in Old Bridge, New Jersey to the Superfund National Priorities List on March 30, 1989 due to hazardous chemicals found in the soil and ground water. The 60-acre site located in Middlesex County was licensed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to accept non-hazardous waste. The landfill borders Cheesequake Creek Tidal Marsh on three sides. In 1984, the State had to close the landfill after part of its southern side collapsed and slid into the marsh. The State observed that the area of the marsh affected by the landfill contained volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. It was later determined that drums containing paint, paint thinner, and various other solvents were buried in the landfill, and when the landfill collapsed these solvents contaminated the ground water. This posed a danger for the nearby water supplies as well as Cheesequake State Park and Raritan Bay, which are used for recreational activities.]]></description>

The 6.6 acre Goose Farm site was used as a hazardous waste disposal area from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s by a manufacturer of polysulfide rubber and solid rocket fuel propellant. The majority of wastes were dumped into a pit dug through fine sand. Waste chemicals from laboratories, drums, and bulk liquids were dumped into the pit. In 1980, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) found that a contaminant plume that originated in the waste pit area had migrated north in the groundwater toward a nearby stream. Also, soil was found to contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).]]></description>

The Jackson Township Landfill operated from 1972 until its closure in 1980. Twenty acres of this 135-acre site were used for dumping millions of gallons of liquid septic tank and coffee waste. The site, originally a titanium ore mining pit, was turned over to the Township by a local mining company in the early 1970s. The landfill originally was located in a relatively undeveloped area, but homes were since built, and shallow wells were constructed close to the landfill. In 1977, residents complained of poor water quality. Tests showed that the Cohansey Aquifer, a shallow aquifer, was contaminated with a variety of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). In 1978, Jackson Township advised residents to stop drinking water from shallow wells. In 1980, a public water supply from a deep well located 1/2 mile southeast of the site was extended to residents near the site. Residences in the immediate area of the site have been connected to the public water supply system.]]></description>

The 220-acre Kin-Buc Landfill site is an inactive landfill that operated from the late 1940s to 1976. From 1971 to 1976, the site was a State-approved landfill for industrial and municipal wastes, both solid and liquid. The site accepted hazardous waste during this period, until the State revoked its permit in 1976 because of violations of several environmental statutes. An estimated 70 million gallons of liquid wastes, including 3 million gallons of oily waste, and over 1 million tons of solid waste, were disposed of between 1973 and 1976. The Kin-Buc site includes two major mounds (Kin-Buc I and Kin-Buc II) and one minor mound (Mound B). Site activities included burying and compacting contained wastes in Kin-Buc II and discharging hazardous liquid wastes into bulldozed pits at the top of Kin-Buc I. Three pits of black, oily leachate, designated Pits A, B, and C were previously located at an edge of Kin-Buc I. Adjacent to the pits was an impoundment referred to as Pool C. Oil, heavily laden with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), accumulated in Pool C and then discharged into Edmonds Creek, a tributary of the Raritan River. The pond also held leachate that contained chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are believed to have come from the landfill. The Edison Township Municipal Landfill lies 600 feet to the south of the site. There is a refuse-filled low-lying area between Kin-Buc I and the Edison Landfill. The Site is located in a wetlands area adjacent to the Raritan River. Historically, aqueous and oily leachate seeped from the landfill into adjoining wetlands, contaminating the wetlands with PCBs. The Site was listed on EPA’s National Priorities List in 1983, and is a PRP-lead site. There are 3,000 people living within 3 miles of the site.]]></description>

KOP treated industrial waste and disposed of hazardous liquids on the site and stopped its operations in 1973. From 1973 to 1975, Evor Phillips, Inc. owned the site and continued operations during part of this period. In 1975, the site was abandoned. The Township regained ownership of the property in 1976, when it foreclosed because of unpaid property taxes. The site had six lagoons, buried drums and plastic containers, and two rusting and torn tankers. Records of the site show that approximately 15 million gallons of wastewater containing toxic chemicals were delivered to the site. The site was fenced in 1988 to protect public health and to prevent further illegal dumping of waste on the site. The site is in a rural area within the Pinelands National Reserve and is adjacent to the Winslow Wildlife Management Area. The Great Egg Harbor River borders the property.

The Lightman Drum Company (LDC) site is located at 139 Route 73 North, Winslow Township, Camden County, New Jersey. The LDC site is situated on approximately 15 acres located in a semi-rural area. Over years of operation, the LDC has been cited by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) for numerous environmental violations. These violations have included the storing of illegal wastes and unlawful discharges of hazardous chemicals. The LDC site is currently an active drum brokerage facility, selling used and reconditioned drums. However, from 1974 through the mid to late 1980's, LDC operated an industrial waste hauling and drum reclamation business where empty drums and drums filled with wastes were stored. Due to the activities at the site, both the on-site soil and groundwater at LDC were contaminated. The site was proposed for inclusion to the National Priorities List (NPL, a.k.a. Superfund) on July 26, 1999.]]></description>

The 16-acre site located in Gloucester County contained a six-acre landfill that accepted household waste, liquid and semi-solid chemical wastes, as well as other industrial materials between 1958 and 1971. Almost three million of gallons of liquid wastes, that included solvents, formaldehyde, paints and thinners, were dumped at the landfill. The groundwater, surface water, soil and sediments at the site were contaminated with heavy metals volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). These pollutants seeped into nearby marshlands, Chestnut Branch Stream, Rabbit Run Stream and Alcyon Lake (which was subsequently closed to recreational use). The air at the site was also contaminated with vapors from the VOCs.]]></description>

In addition to the Home Place Well, ten other municipal wells exist in the area. All eleven municipal wells were investigated to varying degrees to determine the quality of groundwater in the vicinity of the Home Place Well. All of these municipal wells, including Home Place, were
closed by 1987 due to elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Approximately 95% of Lodi's drinking water is now supplied by the Passaic Valley Water Commission, and the remainder is purchased from the Hackensack Water Company. Approximately 24,000 people live in Lodi.]]></description>

Until it was closed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) in 1979, the landfill accepted over 17,000 drums of chemical waste, municipal refuse, large volumes of septage, and millions of gallons of bulk liquid chemical wastes. In 1981, the landfill was ranked on EPA's Interim National Priorities List. In 1981 and 1982, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NJDEP conducted initial studies to ascertain the potential threat to public health and the environment from the landfill. Excavation and sampling demonstrated the presence of leaking drums containing a variety of organic substances, heavy metals, and pesticides. Severe ground water contamination was also documented.]]></description>

The M & T Delisa Landfill disposed of municipal waste from 1945 to 1975 on a 132-acre site in Asbury Park. Seaview Square Mall was constructed on about 25 to 30 acres of the landfill in 1976. The mall construction incorporated control measures to address the potential for contamination. Refuse was excavated and the mall itself is situated on clean fill.
However, since the parking lot is built on refuse, methane gas vents and a system to collect leachate wer the lot. In 1980, the EPA observed leachate seeping from the site into a nearby stream that empties into Deal Lake. However, investigations indicated that ground water, surface water, and soil were not impacted by the M & T Delisa Site (Site). In 1983, the mall and surrounding outside areas were tested for methane gas migration. The results indicated a plume of methane existed about 1 to 3 feet below the ground outside the mall.]]></description>

The primary waste for the site was generated at the tank-trailer cleaning facility. Rinse water from the cleaning of tanks was disposed of in an unlined sand and gravel pit (lagoon) at the site. Disposal of rinse water in the lagoon has since stopped. The affected soil was reportedly left in place and the lagoon was subsequently covered with a variety of demolition rubble and clean fill.

The contaminants found at elevated levels in the soils, groundwater, surface water and sediments include various organic chemicals. In addition, there may be remaining contamination associated with the nine underground storage tanks that were removed from the site. Recently, PCB contamination was discovered by NJDEP on the wall of an on site building.

The Matteo & Sons, Inc. site is located on an approximately 80-acre property which includes an active scrap metal recycling facility, a junkyard, and an inactive landfill. Woodbury Creek borders it to the west, Hessian Run to the north, and a manufactured home community to the south. The Matteo family acquired the property in 1947 and operated an unregistered landfill, a junkyard and a metals recycling facility at the site since at least 1961. From 1971 until 1985, Matteo recovered lead from batteries using a metal separation process called sweating. In conjunction with the lead melting operation, Matteo dumped crushed battery casings in an area of wetlands adjacent to Hessian Run; there were several reports of battery casing incineration and subsequent on-site ash disposal. Drums of unknown waste material were also abandoned at the site. In January 1984, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issued an Administrative Consent Order to Matteo for solid waste violations and required the company to cease waste disposal at the site.]]></description>

The approximately 9.6-acre Superfund site in Middlesex, New Jersey was part of the nation’s early atomic energy program established by the Manhattan Engineer District in 1943.  Activities at the site continued under the Atomic Energy Commission until 1967.  The site was placed in the custody of the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1980 under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program who performed numerous investigations as well as removal actions.  However, in 1997, responsibility for further investigation and remedial activities was transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who currently oversees and monitors the site.

The contaminants identified when cleanup began in the 1980s were radioactive particles in the uranium and radium decay series, various metals (arsenic, chromium, and lead) and volatile organic compounds. Site investigations and monitoring indicated that elevated levels of contaminants were present in soils, sediments, groundwater beneath the site, and surface water moving through the site.]]></description>

The Montgomery Township Housing Development Site (Site) is located in the southern part of Somerset County, New Jersey. Originally, the 71 homes at the 72-acre Site depended on private wells drawing water from the underlying aquifer. In 1978, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in the public well of the neighboring municipality of Rocky Hill. Concerned that the contamination might have spread to the groundwater beneath the housing development, State officials sampled the housing development's wells. Results indicated widespread contamination with various VOCs. Because of the proximity and the similarity of the contaminants present, a decision was made to address the Montgomery Township Housing Development Site and the Rocky Hill Municipal Well Site, also on the NPL, jointly. The area immediately surrounding the Site is wooded and predominantly residential. Beden Brook skirts the northwestern corner of the Site, and the Millstone River bounds it on the east.

The 44-acre site, located on Penns Grove-Pedricktown Road, is a former secondary lead smelting facility that operated from 1972 to 1982. During its years of operation, the company recycled lead from spent automotive batteries. The batteries, after being drained from sulfuric acid, crushed, and then processed for lead recovery, resulted in rubber and plastic waste material. These, along with slag and contaminated soils, were placed in an on-site landfill.

Groundwater at the site contains heavy metals, especially lead and cadmium. Prior sampling of on-site and off-site areas, along with the two nearby streams, identified elevated levels of lead in soils, groundwater, surface water and stream sediments. Since initial sampling, stream sediments have been remediated and are currently being monitored. Residential sampling conducted in 2006 confirmed that levels of lead in residential wells remained below the acceptable drinking water standards.]]></description>

During the course of a site investigation in
West Orange, the EPA collected ground water samples from public water supply wells. The Orange Park and Gist Place municipal supply wells were found to contain tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-1,2-DCE), with PCE and TCE exceeding the EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). Water department data for the period of January to June 2009 confirms the constant presence of the contaminants in the
wells. A third public supply well, known as the Brook Alley well, exhibits similar contamination. That well is no longer inuse. The EPA site investigation identified some possible sources of contamination within the area of the contaminatedwells, and a review of available databases and state files identified several other possible sources of contamination in the vicinity of the wells. The State of New Jersey referred this site to the EPA. The EPA proposed adding the site to its Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) in March 2012. The EPA received a letter from the state supporting placement of the site on the NPL.]]></description>

The site was used by E.F. Drew Co. as a landfill from the 1920s until 1950. The company disposed of unknown quantities of processing waste from the manufacture of edible oils, and cleaning and soap products for household and industrial use.   

From 1950 until the mid-1960s, the site remained an open, unused area until the Town of Boonton purchased the property. During the mid-1960s, the Town covered the site with soil in preparation for construction of the recreational facility. This facility included tennis courts, a baseball field, a playground area, and a refreshment stand. However, because of the biological decay of waste material beneath the field, the area was subjected to strong hydrogen sulfide odors. In 1969, the Town implemented an odor abatement plan for the site, which consists of a 14-foot gravel curtain drain extending 150 feet along one side of the field, a sump for leachate collection, and leachate treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The pump house discharges into a culvert that ultimately discharges into the Rockaway River. The recreation field was closed for many years until the cleanup and restoration work was completed in November 2000.]]></description>

The Picatinny Army Base is located in Morris County approximately 4 miles north of the City of Dover. Picatinny has been in operation for over 100 years and in the past it was a major source of ammunition in wartime. Currently, its mission includes research, development, and pilot-plant production of weapons and constituent explosives and propellants for the Army. At least 156 potentially-hazardous locations exist on the site according to a 1991 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report. They include areas for testing and manufacturing explosives and propellants, shell-burial areas, surface impoundments, landfills, drum-storage areas, and rocket-engine testing areas. Picatinny's 3,000 employees obtain their drinking water from two on-site wells which have been found to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trace amounts of explosive compounds. Drinking water is treated on-site to remove VOCs and explosive compounds are at least an order of magnitude below health-advisory levels. The Army monitors this source of drinking water to ensure that treatment for VOCs has been effective and that explosive-compound levels remain low. The surrounding areas are suburban, as well as summer-vacation areas. Lake Denmark and Picatinny Lake, which are located on base, are used for recreational activities.]]></description>

EPA added the Pohatcong Valley Groundwater Contamination Superfund site in Washington, Franklin, and Greenwich townships (Warren County) to the Superfund National Priorities List on March 30, 1989 because of elevated levels of volatile organic contaminants present in the aquifer. These contaminants were detected in public supply wells in Washington Township, NJ. These public supply wells treat the contamination to meet drinking water standards before the water is distributed. The entire site includes a groundwater contaminant plume which is approximately nine miles long by approximately one and a half miles wide, covering about 2,746 acres. 

Trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), both of which can pose human health threats, were found in the aquifer, the sole source of drinking water for the area. Because of the complexity of the site, EPA has divided the site into three parts.]]></description>

 The Pomona Oaks subdivision consists of about 200 single-family homes in a residential area of Galloway Township. The residential lots range in size from 1/4 to 1/2 acre. Each house had their own private well which was 50 to 60 feet deep. Initially, nearly all of the 200 homes in the residential area relied upon private wells as the sole source of drinking
water. In 1982, residents complained to the State about a foul taste and odor in their drinking water. Subsequent sampling showed the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the water, which resulted in bottled water being provided to some of the area residents. By 1985, all Pomona Oaks subdivision residences were connected to the nearby Absecon water supply. A new municipal well for the community was designed and constructed by the State and is now in use. Existing wells at the site have been sealed. Approximately 8,000 people live within 3 miles of the site.]]></description>

The 26 acre superfund site located in Pleasantville contains an inactive landfill. While in operation, it accepted industrial chemicals, septic tank and sewage wastes, sludges, greases, and oils. Some liquid wastes were poured directly into the landfill, while others were buried in 55-gallon drums. During operations, it is estimated that over nine million gallons of chemical wastes were disposed of at the site. As a result, the ground water was contaminated. The drinking water supply for Atlantic City, approximately one mile away, was threatened by the contamination until the relocation of the water supply wells took place.]]></description>

Quanta Resources operated at an oil processing facility there from 1974 to 1981, when the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection closed the site after discovering large quantities of PCB-laden oil in storage tanks.  

Ground water and soils at the Quanta site are contaminated with arsenic, chromium, lead and harmful chemicals, all of which can pose significant threats to human health. A plume of coal tar creosote, a thick, oily liquid used in roofing and paving that has been classified as a probable carcinogen, exists beneath the site and several adjacent properties, and extends into the Hudson River.

The three-acre Reich Farm property was leased in the 1970s to an independent waste hauler. In 1971, the waste hauler disposed of drums containing organic solvents and residues from the manufacturing of organic chemicals, plastics, and resins. In 1972, soon after the waste disposal was discovered, drums, trench waste, and contaminated soil were removed from the site by Union Carbide, a potentially responsible party (PRP). Nevertheless, as a result of the improper disposal of the hazardous substances, soil in certain areas on the Reich Farm property was contaminated with volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, which are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air. The contaminated soil subsequently contaminated the ground water with organic compounds above applicable federal and State standards. In response, NJDEP closed private wells in the area and put in place zoning ordinances to prevent private use of the groundwater in the area.]]></description>

The 1-acre Renora, Inc. site is located on Main Street in a heavily populated area of the Bonhamtown section of Edison Township, New Jersey. The site was used for the collection and hauling of waste oil and hazardous wastes from 1978 to 1982. During its operation, oils and hazardous waste materials were accepted for transfer storage and blending.  

Contamination of the site occurred as a result of transfer spills and container leaks from accumulated wastes. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) inspection reports consistently noted the lack of site security,
poor housekeeping, and leaking drums and tankers. The NJDEP detected several minor spills on site in 1978 and subsequently determined that Renora lacked the proper registration to act as a special waste transfer station. In 1980,
the NJDEP ordered Renora to cease all activities and clean up the site. Subsequent investigation by the NJDEP showed that, while Renora had ceased operations, it had not begun any efforts to clean up the site. As a result, Renora's license
was revoked. All cleanup activities at the site by the owner ceased in 1980 due to lack of funds. The site was abandoned in 1982, after more than a year of inactivity.]]></description>

The 500-acre Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site is located in a historic iron mining district in the Borough of Ringwood, Passaic County, New Jersey. Site features include abandoned mine shafts and pits, inactive landfills and open waste dumps. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the site was used for the disposal of paint sludge and other waste generated at the Ford Motor Company's Mahwah facility. The site was originally added to the National Priorities List of abandoned hazardous waste sites in 1983.

Between 1984 and 1988, Ford, with EPA oversight, investigated the nature and extent of contamination at the site. The results of this investigation prompted EPA to order Ford to excavate and dispose of paint sludge identified at the site, and to require Ford to monitor ground water and surface water on a long-term basis. Ford performed cleanup work at the site in 1987-1988, removing 7,700 cubic yards of paint sludge and soil. In 1990, Ford removed approximately 600 cubic yards of paint sludge as well as 54 intact and crushed drums.


Ground water monitoring conducted during the early 1990s showed that ground water contaminants were detected sporadically and at lower levels since the paint sludge had been removed from the site. EPA deleted the site from the National Priorities List in 1994, based upon a determination that all appropriate cleanup actions had been implemented.
In 1995, 1998 and in 2004, additional pockets of paint sludge were discovered at the site, prompting further cleanup actions. Ford, under EPA direction, is currently excavating the paint sludge. Since December 2004, an additional 8,600 tons of paint sludge and soil have been removed from the site as part of the ongoing cleanup effort. Furthermore, Ford has entered into an agreement with EPA to conduct a comprehensive reinvestigation of the site, to ensure that all remaining wastes are identified. EPA is currently overseeing the reinvestigation of the site, which began in December 2004 and is ongoing.]]></description>

The Riverside Industrial Park site was added to the National Priorities List of the country's most hazardous waste sites in May 2013. The approximately seven-acre site is located on the banks of the Passaic River in Newark, New Jersey and contains a variety of industrial buildings, some of which are vacant. In 2009, a spill of oily material into the Passaic River was reported and traced back to a pipe on the property. The EPA investigated and discovered that chemicals including benzene, mercury, chromium and arsenic were improperly stored at the site. The agency took immediate actions to prevent further release of these chemicals into the river by plugging discharge pipes and removing the tanks responsible for the spill.

In assessing the site, the EPA discovered multiple threats including numerous storage tanks, both above and below ground, containing a variety of hazardous industrial wastes and solvents. Two underground tanks and most of the other containers were removed by the EPA in 2012. However, further study revealed that soil, ground water and storage tanks at the site are contaminated with volatile organic compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Volatile organic compounds are probable human carcinogens and PCBs are potential cancer-causing chemicals that persist in the environment and can affect the immune, reproductive, nervous and endocrine systems of people and animals. These risks are being assessed and the EPA will determine what additional work is needed in order to reduce or eliminate potential threats from the site.]]></description>

The Rockaway Township Wells site is a 2-square-mile well field area containing a cluster of three municipal wells within 100 feet of each other. In 1979 and 1980, the wells were found to contain a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Groundwater contamination in the area appears to have resulted from several sources. Monitoring wells in the area indicated widespread contamination by chlorinated solvents and fuel components. In 1980, a treatment system for the wells was installed and included an air stripping system and an activated carbon system. Only one of the three wells is currently in operation. The Valley Fill aquifer is the only water supply source capable of meeting the Township's water demand.
 
Groundwater is contaminated with VOCs including trichloroethylene (TCE). Inhaling volatilized organics released into indoor air during water use and ingesting and direct contact with contaminated water were potential health threats prior to the installation of the water treatment system.]]></description>

The Rocky Hill Municipal Well Site (Site) covers 2 acres in the southern part of Somerset County and consists of two wells that were constructed in 1936 to supply the residents of the Borough of Rocky Hill with a source of drinking water. In 1978, the first well was sealed and abandoned because it was contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in particular trichloroethylene (TCE). The second well continued to operate until 1979, when it was also closed due to high levels of TCE. The well reopened for a short time when TCE levels declined, only to be closed again in 1982, when contamination levels increased in the groundwater. The Borough temporarily used a private water supply until an air stripper could be installed on the municipal well. The air stripper has been operating since 1982 to assure drinking water standards are met. Approximately 700 people depend on the Rocky Hill Municipal Well as their drinking water source.   

An investigation of the Site led State officials to sample private wells in the neighboring Montgomery Township Housing Development. Results indicated widespread contamination with various VOCs.

The 200-acre superfund site located in Burlington County was once occupied by a former steel and wire products manufacturing plant. The site contained various facilities that stored insulation products, refurbishing refrigerated trailer and shipping containers, construction equipment storage, and a facility that housed plastic reclamation operations. Raw materials and waste products that these operations produced were stored or buried in several on-site locations. The site included 70 buildings, two inactive sludge lagoons, an abandoned landfill, pits, contaminated soils and slag materials, contaminated river and creek sediments, impacted wetlands, and contaminated groundwater.

Buildings on the site contained contaminated process dust and exposed asbestos. Ground water under the site is contaminated with various heavy metals including chromium, lead, and copper. Soil all around the site is contaminated with heavy metals such as lead. River and creek sediments are contaminated with heavy metals and hazardous oils and tars.]]></description>

The nearly 200-acre Superfund site was used as an unlined landfill for just over 30 years.  The site borders the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and residential properties.  The landfill, which closed in 1968, received solid waste from various parties, including construction and demolition debris, normal household refuse and scrap metal.

Surface soil and surface water sample analysis indicated the presence of metals, PCBs, pesticides and volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, which are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air.]]></description>

From the mid 1800s till 1977, John Lucas & Company and eventually the Sherwin-Williams Company operated a paint manufacturing facility (part of the Sherwin-Williams/Hilliards Creek Site) at a separate location in Gibbsboro, New Jersey.  Reports indicate that paint wastes and sludge were disposed of at the Route 561 Dump Site. 

Soil and sediment sampled from the site revealed the presence of elevated concentrations of lead and arsenic. In response to this contamination, EPA issued an AOC in November 1997 to the Sherwin-Williams Company to perform a Removal Action at the site.  Actions included measures to restrict access to the site and to implement certain engineering controls. Pursuant to the 1997 AOC, Sherwin-Williams covered three bare soil areas that contained high levels of soil contamination with an impermeable membrane and a layer of clean fill material and top soil to prevent direct contact with these areas.]]></description>

During the 1800s, the site was part of the Balbach Smelting and Refining Corporation Works, which refined lead and copper. The refining operations ceased in 1938 and the ownership was transferred to the City of Newark. It was inactive until purchased in 1952 by the Kolker Chemical Company, which manufactured chemicals at the location, including chlorine, methylene chloride, methyl chloride, chloroform and plasticizers. In 1962, the Kolker Chemical Company merged with Vulcan Materials Company.

In 1974, Inland Chemical Corporation purchased the property, phasing out chemical manufacturing and initiating solvent recovery operations in 1975.  In 1976, the southern portion of the property was sold to Darling International for rendering of animal byproducts. Inland and McKesson Envirosystems Company merged in 1981. In October 1982, an explosion and fire destroyed much of the operations at the site and it has been inactive and vacant ever since. In 1987, Safety-Kleen Corporation acquired the stock of McKesson and renamed the company Safety-Kleen Envirosystems.

In 1982, McKesson Envirosystem Company entered into an Administrative Consent Order with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) for investigation of the site. Subsequent investigations and inspections identified a number of units and areas of concern. In 1993, Safety-Kleen Envirosystems Company and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which shipped waste to the site) entered into an Administrative Consent Order with NJDEP to conduct remedial investigations and remedial measures, if necessary.]]></description>

The Sayreville Landfill is an inactive municipal landfill covering approximately 30 acres in a moderately industrialized area of Middlesex County. The Borough of Sayreville owned and operated the site as a municipal landfill beginning in 1970. It was licensed to receive municipal waste and light industrial waste; however, hazardous waste was allegedly disposed of during operations and after closure in 1977. Part of the site is in a wetland adjacent to the South River.Approximately 67,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site; the closest residence is located 1/2 mile away. The river waters adjacent to the Site are designated for both primary and secondary contact recreation. Pond Creek forms a portion of the Site boundary to the north and northwest and Duck Creek on the south and southwest. These waters are classified by the NJDEP as fresh water Non-Trout. The Site is partially located within the tidal wetlands of the river with drainage swales along the western part of the property. Because of the tidal influence and the infusion of salt water, private wells in the area are not used. The Sayreville and Perth Amboy well fields are located within three miles of the site. There are other municipal wells in the vicinity which are tested regularly.]]></description>

Schering began production here in 1938, expanding throughout the years. The facility generates hazardous wastes, which are predominantly by-products of fermentation, laboratory, chemical synthesis and purification operations. Schering stores these wastes in two containerized hazardous waste storage sheds and a waste solvent blending tank, pursuant to their Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). 

Potential Threats and Contaminants
In 1984, Schering notified the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that groundwater samples from its production well #1 revealed the presence of high concentrations of volatile organics. The primary contaminants exceeding standards are volatile organics such as benzene, toluene and methylene chloride.
Contamination at the site is attributed to poor waste management practices. Contents of drums were spilled in unpaved drum yards and the unloading area (former railroad siding), wastes dumped in four surface impoundments, and leaks discovered from the industrial sewage line and facility storage tanks. Data also indicates the presence of similar contamination off-site, adjacent to the facility.]]></description>

EPA added the Scientific Chemical Processing site in Carlstadt, New Jersey to the Superfund National Priorities List on September 1, 1983 because hazardous chemicals were found in the soil and ground water.  The six acre superfund site was used as a processing facility for the recovery and disposal of various wastes.  Hazardous substances were stored improperly on-site and contaminated the soil and groundwater.  On-site ground water and soil contamination include PCBs, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are potentially harmful contaminants that can easily evaporate into the air.  Off-property ground water and the adjacent Peach Island Green are also contaminated.  Approximately 14,500 residents live within a two-mile radius of the site, and several private residences are within one mile of the site.  The site is now vacant.  A group of more than 100 potentially responsible parties is conducting the cleanup work at the site.]]></description>

The Sharkey Landfill site is approximately 90 acres in size and is divided into five separate fill areas: the North Fill, South Fill, Northwest-North Fill, Northwest-South Fill, and Southwest Fill. The North Fill is a 26-acre island in the Rockaway River. The South Fill is an approximately 32-acre area adjacent to the Rockaway and Whippany Rivers and the Parsippany-Troy Hills wastewater treatment plant. The Northwest-North and Northwest-South Fills are about 11 and 15 acres in size, respectively, and were originally one fill area. The two fill areas were separated as a result of the construction of Interstate 280. The 9-acre Southwest Fill area is located along the Whippany River southeast of Ridgedale Avenue in East Hanover. The site began operating in 1945 and accepted municipal waste material until September 1972. During that time, the landfill also accepted commercial, industrial, and hazardous waste materials. Records indicate that various organic compounds were disposed of at the site, including toluene, benzene, chloroform, dichloroethylene, and methylene chloride. Although there have been allegations of waste disposal after 1972, the site is believed to have been generally inactive until 1979, when excavation related to the expansion of the Parsippany-Troy Hills wastewater treatment plant was initiated.]]></description>

The site comprises the former paint manufacturing plant and the waters of Hilliards Creek which flow into Kirkwood Lake. From the mid 1800s till 1977, John Lucas & Company and eventually the Sherwin-Williams Company operated a paint manufacturing facility on the property. Historic features on-site included: several former lagoons for wastewater and paint sludge settling; tank farms (large above ground storage tanks); a railroad line and spur; drum storage areas; and large-scale facility operations.    

Decades of direct discharge of materials to Hilliards Creek from the lagoons, improper storage and handling resulting in spills and releases, and leaking tanks all led to widespread contamination associated with the former plant operations. High levels of various contaminants including lead, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds were found in the soil, groundwater, and to a lesser extent, in sediments. Free-phase product containing benzene, ethylbenzene, xylene, naphthalene and 2-methylnapthalene were identified in groundwater in 1983.]]></description>

Specific products manufactured included custom-wired cables, ignition harnesses, ignition leads, electrical connectors, cozxial cables and related hardware.

Wastewater generated in the metal finishing operations was discharged directly to the swamp and wetlands located north of the site from 1946 until 1972. In 1972, an on-site percolation lagoon was constructed to contain the wastewater. The lagoon outfall, which discharged to the wetlands bounding the Lamington River, was permitted under a New Jersey Pollutant Elimination Discharge System (NJPDES) permit.

Several chemical manufacturing activities took place on the site from the early 1900s to the 1990s, including the production, storage and packaging of moth balls and flakes. EPA added the site to its National Priorities List in September 2007 after samples indicated the release of dioxins, benzenes, naphthalene, PCBs and other semi-volatile or volatile compounds into the Hackensack River and adjacent wetlands.

The site lies in the Hackensack Meadowlands, which EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have identified as a Significant Habitat Complex that may provide habitat for state- or federally-designated threatened or endangered species. Contamination appears to discharge from ground water to the Hackensack, as well as overland runoff, including through a drainage ditch along the southern property line.  Release of hazardous substances to the surrounding ground water has been documented since at least the early 1980s. In the past, contamination came from several sources, including two lagoons located on the eastern portion of the site, tanks and drums that contain dioxin-contaminated asbestos and other pollutants.  The dioxin-contaminated asbestos has been collected and placed in shipping containers waiting for eventual transport, and all remaining tanks have been emptied. Fish consumption warnings (particularly crab) and a health advisory have been issued for the Hackensack River, potentially due in part to contamination from the Standard Chlorine site.]]></description>

he Standard T Chemical Company facility was located at 1312 Elizabeth Avenue, on a 2.1 acre parcel in an industrially zoned area of Linden, New Jersey. Standard T produced specialty inks, lacquers and varnishes for marking electrical wire and cable. It operated this facility from 1925 to 1986. Operations at the facility incorporated the use of solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone and toluene, and the waste solvents were stored in an area containing twenty 55-gallon drums. Standard T also stored solvents and varnishes in underground storage tanks, which they later excavated and removed from the site.

The company ceased all operations at this site in 1986, triggering the Industrial Site Recovery Act of New Jersey, which requires investigation and, if necessary, cleanup. Standard T completed these requirements and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) closed this case in October 1997, granting Standard T Chemical Co a "no further determination" for the site.

Unknown historical releases are believed to have contaminated the soils with volatile organic compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). However, the groundwater was not impacted.]]></description>

PA added the Syncon Resins site in South Kearny, New Jersey to the Superfund National Priorities List on September 1, 1983 because hazardous chemicals were found in the soil and ground water.  The 15-acre superfund site located in Hudson County contained a facility that manufactured paints, varnishes, and resins.  The site contained two unlined lagoons, numerous large bulk storage tanks and underground storage tanks, and over 12 buildings.  Prior to their removal, the site also contained approximately 12,800 55-gallon drums.  Many of the 55-gallon drums have rusted and spilled contents onto the soil.  During the production process, wastewater containing solvents was pumped to an unlined lagoon, left to evaporate or drain into the soil.]]></description>

The Tabernacle Drum Dump site is located on a wooded, one-acre parcel of undeveloped land located on Carranza Road in Tabernacle Township, in the northern region of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Land in the area is used primarily for agriculture and recreation. Approximately 75 to 100 residents live within a 1-mile radius of the site and most are dependent on groundwater wells for drinking water and agricultural purposes. The Cohansey aquifer, which is a source of drinking water to most of the residents in the vicinity of the site, has a depth of approximately 100 feet. In a one-time dumping incident in the summer of 1976 or 1977, approximately 200 containers (55-gallon drums, 20-gallon containers, and several 5-gallon pails) of solvents, paint, and paint sludges were dumped on a 2,000-square-foot area of the property. These containers were discovered by Tabernacle Township officials in 1982. The Burlington County Health Department inspected the site for the Township and referred the case to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). NJDEP followed-up with a more detailed site inspection, collecting drum and soil samples which revealed the presence of carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, chromium and lead.   

Deterioration and leakage of some containers resulted in visible soil contamination. The drums and contaminated soil were removed in 1984.]]></description>

The former U.S. Radium Corporation facility, which covers 2 acres in the City of Orange, Essex County, New Jersey, is a former radium-processing plant where extraction, production, application, and distribution took place from about 1915 through 1926. Approximately 1/2 to 2 tons of ore per day was processed and disposed of on and off the property. As a result of those operations, the facility buildings and soil became contaminated with radionuclides. In addition, radium-contaminated soil and debris were identified at approximately 250 noncontiguous properties in the vicinity of the
former plant and at various other locations throughout the municipalities of Orange, West Orange, and South Orange. At this time, investigations to identify additional contaminated properties are complete, and the cleanup of contaminated properties is essentially complete. The noncontiguous affected properties are occupied by residences, light industries, offices, grocery stores, and apartment buildings. The main portion of the Site is located in a densely populated, urban residential neighborhood. All area residents and businesses are supplied with municipal water.]]></description>

The industrial history of the site dates back to the 1880s when two textile mills were constructed there. Penick Corporation purchased the property in 1945, ceasing all textile manufacturing. From 1945 to 1978, Penick Corporation primarily manufactured pharmaceutical products. In 1978, Penick terminated all manufacturing operations, and by 1983 they had decommissioned all manufacturing equipment.

In 1983, Brodson Properties Inc. bought the property, and by 1985 they had demolished all of the structures on the property. Since 1985, the site has been dormant, with the exception of environmentally related actions. In 2002, Unilever Bestfoods became the owner of the site.

There were leaks and spills in several areas, including former drum storage areas, former tank areas and a lagoon, which contaminated the soil and groundwater at the site. The soils are contaminated with volatile organics, pesticides, metals and semi-volatile organics. Groundwater is contaminated with benzene, toluene, phenol, and chromium.]]></description>

From the mid 1800s till 1977, John Lucas & Company and eventually the Sherwin-Williams Company operated a paint manufacturing facility (part of the Sherwin-Williams/Hilliards Creek Site) at a separate location in Gibbsboro, New Jersey. Reports indicate that paint wastes and solvents were dumped and/or poured onto the ground at the United States Avenue Burn Site and were often burned.

Soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater sampled from the site have identified contaminants such as lead and arsenic. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected to a lesser extent in the groundwater. In response to these findings, the Sherwin-Williams Company installed a fence around the site. In addition, in September 1995, EPA entered into an agreement with the Sherwin-Williams Company to perform a removal action to reduce the existing public health hazard and environmental impacts.  By installing silt fencing to prevent off-site contaminant migration, maintaining the existing fence, and conducting excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils, EPA has reduced the short-term risks associated with the identified contaminants.]]></description>

The building on site was constructed between 1967 and 1968 to operate as an aluminum extrusion facility. Aluminum billets as raw material were heated and extruded through dies under pressure. Lineal products from the extrusion processes were subsequently applied with a chromium coat and then with paints. The products were then cut to specified lengths before the shipping to customers. The shipped products were further fabricated to produce consumer products such as residential windows and doors, light fixtures, truck bodies, and electrical and computer equipment.

Rinse waters and waste materials were generated at the facility from the manufacturing operations. An evaporation tank was utilized to treat rinse waters but was later replaced. Other waste materials were stored at various locations before being shipped off-site for disposal. Various chemical compounds were utilized in the manufacturing operations including chromium, xylene, paints, oils, caustic solutions, and methylene chloride.]]></description>

The Upper Deerfield Township Sanitary Landfill site is an inactive landfill covering 14 acres on a 23-acre tract of land. The site originally was used as a gravel pit from 1938 to 1960, when the Township purchased 12 acres; the remaining acreage was purchased by the Township in 1977. The property was operated as a municipal landfill licensed to accept household waste until it closed in 1983. Residents became concerned over the quality of their water, and in response to requirements by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the Township installed three monitoring wells.    

The County sampled residential wells and the monitoring wells and found them to be contaminated with mercury and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In 1983, the State and the County advised residents to discontinue using their wells, and the Township began supplying the affected residents with bottled water. In 1986 the Township installed a public water supply well and distribution system to provide potable water to residents in the area using funds provided by the State.]]></description>

The Vineland State School site was a residential and treatment facility for mentally handicapped women. The State's Department of Human Services ran the facility, which was on a 195-acre campus located in a primarily suburban and residential setting on East Landis Avenue in Vineland. The school operated an unregulated incinerator and landfill on the property to dispose of its waste. The incinerator has been dismantled, and the pit was filled in and graded. In the early 1980s, hazardous chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may have been dumped at the site. The school property consists of five distinct subsites, where the following activities took place: (1) the school allegedly dumped between 6,000 and 8,000 one-quart containers of mercury-based pesticides into ponded water, about 20 feet below the ground surface; (2) an on-site contractor spilled approximately 150 gallons of PCB-laced transformer oil onto the ground when four large transformers were removed in the mid-1970s; (3) starting in the 1950s, the school used a part of the site as a general dump for any type of wastes, including chemicals produced and used at the school; (4) during the early to mid-1950s, the school dumped an unknown amount of transformer oil laced with PCBs from out-of-service electrical transformers; and (5) approximately 10 cubic yards of pesticides and possibly other chemicals the school used for farming may have been dumped into a 10-foot-deep pit some time during the 1950s. The State of New Jersey investigated a PCB spill that occurred in subsite 2, which led to an extensive cleanup of PCB-contaminated soil, building rubble, concrete and construction material, soil contaminated with gasoline, and asbestos roofing. Approximately 13,620 people within 3 miles of the site depend on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water. The school itself housed approximately 1,050 residents]]></description>

From 1948 until 1971, site operators extracted thorium and other elements from monazite ore at the 6 1/2-acre W.R. Grace & Co./Wayne Inteim Storage Site (the Site) in Wayne Township. In 1971, W.R. Grace ceased processing monazite ore and amended its Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license to cover only the storage of radioactive materials. The company decontaminated the property (burying much of the material) in 1974 to the criteria established at that time. In 1975, the NRC released the land without radiological restriction, with the condition that the deed indicate the presence of radioactive material beneath the Site surface.In 1980, the State of New Jersey conducted an aerial survey that showed elevated radiation levels at the Site, an adjacent school bus maintenance facility, a township park, the banks of Sheffield Brook, and the Pompton Plains railroad spur. Much of the off-site contamination was spread by runoff and water discharges from the Site. Additional surveys were conducted in 1982 and 1983. Based on this information, the Site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984. From 1985 through 1987, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), acting under its authority through the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1984 (PL 98-50) which specifically addressed the Site, investigated and removed soils contaminated with radionuclides from the school bus maintenance facility, township park, and the banks of Sheffield Brook. The contaminated soils were then stockpiled at the Site. This Site was acquired by the federal government for this purpose.

Approximately 1,900 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site, and 300 people live within a mile. The residents rely on private wells for drinking water supplies. The closest drinking water well is approximately 1,000 feet from the site.]]></description>

The Witco Chemical Corp. (Oakland Plant) operates a technical research facility for the development of specialty chemicals at this 9-acre site on Bauer Drive in Oakland. From 1966 through 1984, the company neutralized laboratory wastewater in an underground tank and then discharged it into a network of six unlined subsurface seepage pits. This network lies in an aquifer used for domestic and industrial purposes. The New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) inspected the operation in 1982. Petroleum hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in soil and groundwater samples. The operation is located in an industrial park. It is bordered by Hopper Lake, a recreational water body, and a housing development. Approximately 43,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site, and 5,000 live within 1 mile. The entire population draws its drinking water supplies from either municipal or private wells that tap the aquifer of concern. A freshwater wetland lies within a mile of the site, and Franklin Lake, used for recreation, is 3 miles downstream]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[EPA (http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/woodbrook/index.html)

EPA added the Woodbrook Road Dump site to the Superfund National Priorities List on April 30, 2003 due to contamination of the soil and ground water on the 70-acre property. The site is heavily wooded and bordered by Bound Brook and the wetlands of Dismal Swamp. The land was used as a dump in the 1940s and ’50s and accepted household waste as well as industrial waste until it was shut down by the state of New Jersey in 1958. The current owner of the properties is Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (TETCO).

In September 1999, partially buried, leaking capacitors were discovered and removed. A subsequent investigation revealed high levels of hazardous substances in the soils and sediments. Contaminants include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a known carcinogen, high levels of inorganics as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The ground water was also found to be contaminated with VOCs, inorganic constituents and PCBs.]]></description>

The Woodland Route 72 Dump site is a 12-acre industrial dump located along Route 72, just two miles away from an almost identical site on Route 532. Both are on the National Priorities List. From the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, various wastes were brought to this uncontrolled disposal site in 55-gallon drums and in bulk transport. Records indicated that the wastes were dumped into open pits and trenches, and then burned; however, investigations revealed that substantial amounts of these wastes were also buried. In addition to numerous chemical contaminants in soil and water, some areas of the site exhibited gamma radiation exposure levels at greater than the EPA-recommended action level. Active commercial cranberry bogs lie 1/2 mile northwest of the site. The area is sparsely populated: approximately 900 people live within a 4-mile radius of the site, and only one private residence is located within a 3-mile radius. Land use in the area is limited to cranberry and blueberry cultivation, and harvesting of cedar and pine for wood products. Residents rely on ground water for drinking, household use, and irrigation. The closest well is 1 1/2 miles from the dump, and there is no evidence of well contamination. The site is located within the Pinelands National Reserve, which was
created by the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978. Pope Branch, an intermittent stream, is located approximately 500 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the site. Wetlands are located approximately 1/4 mile southwest of the site.]]></description>

The Woodland Route 532 Dump site is an inactive chemical waste dump covering about 20 acres along Route 532. Illegal dumping started after nearby residents forced abandonment of an almost identical site along Route 72, about two miles away, which also is on the National Priorities List. Several chemical companies disposed of wastes here from 1956 until the mid-1960s, dumping, burning, and burying drummed and bulk materials. The site included several sludge mounds and numerous sandy depressions containing drums. The area around the site is sparsely populated. One private residence is located within a 3-mile radius of the dump, and 900 people live within 4 miles. The closest residences rely on private well water. The site is located within the Preservation Area District of the New Jersey Pinelands. Goodwater Run, an intermittent stream, borders the site to the east. An active cranberry bog is located 4,000 feet to the southwest: local cranberry producers use the surface waters to flood the cranberry bogs.]]></description>

BASF, formerly American Cyanamid Corporation (ACC) Agricultural Division, is a 683 acre site, located at the intersection of Quakerbridge Rd and US Route 1 in West Windsor, NJ. BASF bought the operations of ACC Agricultural Division from American Home Products (who purchased American Cyanamid in 1994) in 2000.  However, American Home Products retained ownership of the 683 acre property less the liability for the cleanup of the contaminated SWMUs on site.  American Home Products changed its name to Wyeth Corp in March 2002.  Real estate development company, Rouse Corp, purchased the property from Wyeth Corp for $35 million in 2006.

No manufacturing or production was conducted at the site, which is now shutdown.  The activities included research and development of agricultural chemicals and animal health and nutrition products. There are woodlands and farmland near the site. BASF is cleaning up the site under a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) order.

Potential Threats and Contaminants

The groundwater and soil at the site have been contaminated with pesticides, (4,4-DDT and 4,4-DDE, No.2. Delta-BHC), chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The main source of contamination of the groundwater is a landfill (Landfill No. 2), which is located in a wooded area in the southern section of the site. It was used to dispose of laboratory glassware and small containers of laboratory wastes.]]></description>

The Zschiegner Refining Company operated from 1964 to 1992 as a precious metals recovery facility. On-site operations included the chemical stripping of precious metals from watch bands, film, and electrical components. In October 1992, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration raided the facility based on suspicions of illegal drug manufacturing.                                                              
Approximately 3,000 different chemicals (including peroxide, cyanide, caustics, and acids) were found improperly stored throughout the site. The 6.1-acre site is located in a rural residential area. The Haystack Brook and its associated wetlands run southward on the eastern portion of the property and a tributary to the brook runs along the southern portion of the property. A single-story building was present on the southwestern portion of the property and a collapsed cesspool is between the building and Haystack Brook. Two homes border the site; the closest house is within 50 yards of the on-site building. During initial removal actions, approximately 2,000 gallons of acidic solutions, 1,600 gallons of basic solutions, and 1,400 small containers of hazardous substances were transferred to acceptable containers and disposed of off site. The presence of inorganic contamination in soil, sediments, ground water, and the building was found during the remedial investigation.]]></description>
