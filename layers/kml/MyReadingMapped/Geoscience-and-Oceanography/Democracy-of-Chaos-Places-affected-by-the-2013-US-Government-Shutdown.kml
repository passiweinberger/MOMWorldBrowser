The Senate voted 81 to 18 Wednesday night to reopen the federal government and raise the nation's borrowing limit, hours before the Treasury Department faced the possibility of being unable to pay all of America's bills for the first time in modern history.

The House followed suit, voting 285-144, to end the latest damaging battle of divided government in a polarized Congress.

President Barack Obama signed the legislation early Thursday. He said he would reopen the government immediately to "lift this cloud of uncertainty and unease" that settled on the nation and start fixing the damage.

"There is a lot of work ahead of us, including our need to earn back the trust of the American people that has been lost over the last few weeks," Obama said in a brief speech at the White House.]]></description>

With the Treasury Department warning that it could run out of money to pay national obligations within a day, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday evening, 81 to 18, to approve a proposal hammered out by the chamber’s Republican and Democratic leaders after the House on Tuesday was unable to move forward with any resolution. The House followed suit a few hours later, voting 285 to 144 to approve the Senate plan, which would fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt limit through Feb. 7.]]></description>

			<name>16-Day Government Shutdown Cost the economy $24 Billion, Standard &amp; Poor's Says</name>

			<description><![CDATA[huffingtonpost.com (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/government-shutdown-cost_n_4110818.html)
 
WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has taken at least $24 billion out of the United States economy, the financial ratings agency Standard & Poor's said Wednesday.
The firm said the shutdown caused it to cut its forecast of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter by at least 0.6 percentage point. The agency lowered its estimate for GDP growth to close to 2 percent from 3 percent.

The estimate represents a staggering cost to the economy of a completely self-inflicted political catastrophe. Unlike the 2008 economic crisis and other past recessions, the government shutdown had nothing to do with larger economic trends. The numbers show Washington's brinksmanship caused real damage beyond furloughed government workers and the Washington, D.C., region.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/eric-cantor-government-shutdown_n_4101592.html?utm_hp_ref=politics):

It's been more than two weeks since the Senate passed a "clean" funding bill to open the government, with no strings attached. Typically, any House member could call up that bill and request a vote. But on Sept. 30, on the eve of the shutdown, Republicans quietly changed the House rules so only one person can bring that bill up: Cantor.

Moran said the rules change was "unprecedented" and has left Virginians, along with every one else, at the hands of Cantor to end the shutdown, even though he refuses to do so. The Senate-passed bill already has the votes to pass in the House and would be signed into law by the president, if it were allowed to get a vote.]]></description>

Last year, Oklahoma and Louisiana were the most dependent, with federal aid comprising 50 percent or more of their revenue. Ten other states were more than 40-percent dependent, compared to only one state in 2005, Louisiana, at 45 percent...

The current budget brinkmanship is just the latest development in a well-financed, broad-based assault on the health law, Mr. Obama’s signature legislative initiative. Groups like Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight, as is Club for Growth, a business-backed nonprofit organization. Some, like Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty, both aimed at young adults, are upstarts. Heritage Action is new, too, founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of its sister group, the Heritage Foundation.

The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been deeply involved with financing the overall effort. A group linked to the Kochs, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, disbursed more than $200 million last year to nonprofit organizations involved in the fight. Included was $5 million to Generation Opportunity, which created a buzz last month with an Internet advertisement showing a menacing Uncle Sam figure popping up between a woman’s legs during a gynecological exam.

The groups have also sought to pressure vulnerable Republican members of Congress with scorecards keeping track of their health care votes; have burned faux “Obamacare cards” on college campuses; and have distributed scripts for phone calls to Congressional offices, sample letters to editors and Twitter and Facebook offerings for followers to present as their own.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Congressman Paul Ryan's budget, the hallmark of the GOP budget planning, cuts social spending to reallocate the funds to military spending. Thus, there is no reduction in spending or debt reduction. Nor does the government get any smaller when he employs the private sector in the military and increases the privatization of government services on the national credit card. Thus a growing amount of the private sector now makes its income on our taxes.

If you truly want better fiscal accountability you must apply the cuts to business interests as well. And, if you truly want smaller government, shutdown the ability of business to intervene in government and limit it's ability to control government and government spending that benefits business. But, in reducing the size and cost of government will cost the private sector lots of jobs and earnings since our economy is so dependent on government spending.]]></description>

			<name>Volatility Arbitrage benefits from a stalemated Congress.</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[Notice how the stock market is going up and down at a rapid pace during the government shutdown due to the news about the shutdown. That is because there is money to be made in Volatility Arbitrage. The more they can keep the economy in a volatile state, the more money is to be made by those who have money.

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_arbitrage)

Volatility arbitrage: is not "true economic arbitrage" (in the sense of a risk free profit opportunity). It relies on predicting the future direction of implied volatility. Even portfolio based volatility arbitrage approaches which seek to "diversify" volatility risk can experience "black swan" events when changes in implied volatility are correlated across multiple securities and even markets.
-----

As I see it, one way to profit from volatility is to control congress and have the two parties opposing and stalemating each other. The exact situation we are experiencing in this government shutdown.]]></description>

their Federal Tax dollar.

- For example South Dakota got 85% of its tax dollar back, New Mexico got 81% back, and Mississippi got 70% back, Wyoming got 63% back, and North Dakota got 60% back, While, Maine got 54% back, Vermont got 44% back, Hawaii got 35% back, and Iowa got 27% back.
- However the largest states get a much smaller share of their money back. For example, New York got only 21% of its Federal Tax dollar back, California got 20% back, Florida got 17% back, Texas got 16%, back, and Georgia got 15%.]]></description>

----
huffingtonpost.com (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/12/default-american-revolution-morgan-griffith_n_4089911.html)
 
Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) compared the looming default to the American Revolution on Saturday after a meeting with House Republicans.
 
“We have to make a decision that’s right long-term for the United States, and what may be distasteful, unpleasant and not appropriate in the short run may be something that has to be done,” Griffith said, according to The Hill. “I will remind you that this group of renegades that decided that they wanted to break from the crown in 1776 did great damage to the economy of the colonies. They created the greatest nation and the best form of government, but they did damage to the economy in the short run.”
 
However, Rep. Griffith fails to understand that the nation and economy were a lot smaller then, so the impact of a government shutdown and default on an economy that was primarily a self-supporting agriculture economy of 2 million people was minimal when compared to an economy of 313 million people that is now an industrialized society.]]></description>

This is no way to run a government of the people. Since when does one minor portion of the population get to rule over the majority. But that is where we are right now. The extremists rule and big business, who spend $3 billion a year in lobbying Washington, now rule via a corporate oligarchy.

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrade#Warnings_of_a_downgrade)

On April 18, 2011, U.S.-based rating agency S&P issued a "negative" outlook on the U.S.'s "AAA" (highest quality) sovereign-debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there was a one-in-three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. S&P considered the government budget deficit of more than 11 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and net government debt rising to about 80 percent or more of GDP by 2013, to be high relative to other "AAA" countries.[9] According to S&P, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a "stable" outlook.[4] The S&P press release stated:
 
"We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policymakers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium– and long-term budgetary challenges by 2013; if an agreement is not reached and meaningful implementation is not begun by then, this would in our view render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than that of peer 'AAA' sovereigns."]]></description>

The ratings of all outstanding U.S. sovereign debt securities have also been placed on RWN, as has the U.S. Short-term foreign currency rating of 'F1+'. The Outlook on the Long-term ratings was previously Negative. The U.S. Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AAA'.

Fitch expects to resolve the RWN by the end of Q114 at the latest, although timing would necessarily reflect developments and events, including the duration of any agreement to raise the debt ceiling.]]></description>

WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Conservative activists are protesting the forced closing of a private North Carolina hotel and restaurant as a casualty of the partial federal government shutdown.

The Pisgah Inn leases space on government property along the Blue Ridge Parkway, a 470-mile road overseen by the National Park Service that winds through the North Carolina and Virginia mountains.

Inn owner Bruce O'Connell said Saturday about 100 protesters gathered on the road's shoulder to protesting the business's forced closure. O'Connell says park rangers began blocking its three driveways on Friday.

Parkway Chief Ranger Steve Stinnett says he was directed by superiors to act because the business is subject to the federal government shutdown.]]></description>

With Congress locked up over the budget, and with the debt ceiling deadline in a few weeks, Congress may not get to pass a new farm bill. The farm bill provides subsidies for dairy farmers who say without it, the price of milk could go up to seven or eight dollars a gallon.

The Myers family of Poco Loco dairy farm in the Grice community produce 7,200 pounds in milk every two days. But without government subsidies, they worry about the future. 

"Its had an immediate impact here on us, a small local farm. Our local FSA office in Tyler is closed and we don't have support from that office," says Jennifer Myers.]]></description>

Pentagon Furloughs: Most Of Its 400,000 Civilian Employees Ordered Back To Work

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work.

The decision by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is based on a Pentagon legal interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act.

That measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama shortly before the partial government shutdown began Tuesday.

The Pentagon did not immediately say on Saturday exactly how many workers will return to work. The Defense Department said "most" were being brought back.]]></description>

Much of BAE’s work in defense electronics, armored vehicles and ship repair is funded by prior-year budgets and thus does not immediately require additional appropriations to continue into the new fiscal year. However, without representatives from the Defense Contract Management Agency to perform required inspections, production activity at all of the major military contractors is beginning to slow. DCMA has furloughed 85% of its personnel for the duration of the government shutdown.]]></description>

For offshore energy, it’s a mixed bag. Offshore renewable energy activities would be halted. Work on many offshore oil and gas drilling processes, like work on the National Environmental Policy Act will come to a stop, which would cause delays for companies seeking permits to drill. But emergency response personnel would remain on-hand, and some permitting actions necessary to facilitate safe ongoing drilling operations would continue.]]></description>

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Thursday that while it's bad members of Congress have allowed a government shutdown, it would be worse if they failed to increase the government's borrowing authority later this month.

First and foremost, he said, retirement and disability benefits for millions of Americans would be at risk.

"In a government shutdown, Social Security checks still go out on time," Obama said. "In an economic shutdown, if we don't raise the debt ceiling, they don't go out on time."]]></description>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service will continue manning every meat production facility with full-time inspectors, even as many government programs are halted. But the FDA actually oversees the safety of the vast majority of the country's food industry. And according to a memo released by the Department of Health and Human Services, the bulk of FDA food inspectors have been deemed non-essential, so will inspect few if any food facilities until Congress and the president agree on a bill to fund the federal government.]]></description>

Last Thursday, Joyce, 77, and Ralph Spencer, 80, were told they’d have to leave their home in Lake Mead, Nev., because it is situated on government land, KTNV reported. Lake Mead is a national park, and the area has been closed as a result of the government shutdown that began on October 1.

Ms. Spencer told KTNV that a park ranger said they’d have just 24 hours to vacate the premises. Their cabin in Lake Mead is technically considered a vacation home, and one of the requirements for purchasing it was that they would have a primary residence elsewhere.

They’ve owned the Lake Mead property since the 1970s, but with the ongoing gridlock in Washington, it’s unclear when they’ll be able to return. Since being evicted, the couple says they've been staying with family.]]></description>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which monitors the nation's 100 commercial nuclear power plants, is set to furlough 3,600 employees on Thursday after depleting funds amid the government shutdown.

The shutdown will disable non-emergency licensing of nuclear reactors, emergency exercises, and the inspection of nuclear materials and waste licensees. Three-hundred "essential" personnel will stay on the job, 150 of which are "resident inspectors" who will address immediate safety and security matters, the NRC said.]]></description>

RALEIGH, N.C., Oct 15 (Reuters) - North Carolina has become the first state to cut off welfare benefits to poor residents in the wake of the partial federal government shutdown, ordering a halt to processing November applications until a deal is reached to end the federal standstill.

More than 20,000 people - most of them children - receive monthly benefits aimed at helping them buy food and other basic supplies through North Carolina's welfare program, called Work First, which is fully funded by the federal government. Recipients must reapply each month.]]></description>
