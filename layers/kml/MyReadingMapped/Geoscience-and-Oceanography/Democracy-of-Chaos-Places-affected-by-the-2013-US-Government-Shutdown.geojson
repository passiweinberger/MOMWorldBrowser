Lake Mead is a national park, and the area has been closed as a result of the government shutdown that began on October 1. Ms. Spencer told KTNV that a park ranger said they’d have just 24 hours to vacate the premises. Their cabin in Lake Mead is technically considered a vacation home, and one of the requirements for purchasing it was that they would have a primary residence elsewhere. They’ve owned the Lake Mead property since the 1970s, but with the ongoing gridlock in Washington, it’s unclear when they’ll be able to return.
