Agrico Chemical Co. is a Superfund site located in Pensacola, Florida. The facility operated under different companies from 1881 to 1975, when it was shut down by Agrico Chemical Company. The EPA found radium-226, radium-228,[2] sulfuric, lead and fluorides in the groundwater.[3]  The facility produced sulfuric acid from pyrite from 1881 to 1920. The EPA believes that the lead and sulfuric acid came from corroding lead tanks that held the sulfuric acid. From 1920 to 1975, the facility produced fertilizer.[4]   

By 1979, all of the equipment had been removed from the site. Today the site has one foundation for a warehouse, and two ponds. Next to the foundation is a mini storage center.]]></description>

According to Lenntech, "Workers in gold mines use cyanide (CN) to purify gold from rocks. This is applied for example in Rumania. At 22:00 hours on January 30, 2000 cyanide (fig. 2) used in a gold mine in Baia Mare overflowed into the major river the Somes and subsequently into the river Tisza. The cause of the spill was a break in the dam that surrounded a settling basin. This resulted in the release of at least 100.000 cubic meters of water with very high cyanide concentrations. The waste water did not only contain cyanide, but also heavy metals such as copper, zinc and lead. Copper concentrations exceeded the heavily polluted threshold 40-160 times, the zinc concentration was twice above this standard and the lead concentration 5-9 times greater. ]]></description>

The Union Pacific Railroad's 140-acre tie-treating facility is about a quarter mile south of Laramie, Wyoming, along the Laramie River. The railroad used the site for wood-preserving operations for nearly 100 years. The railroad and its contractor applied creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) to railroad ties to protect them from weathering. During this time, wood treating chemicals were spilled and disposed of on the site, contaminating soil and groundwater.                                                         
In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the site on the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) for cleanup. The company agreed to isolate the wastes and treat groundwater so that the contamination would not spread. Among the cleanup actions were realignment of the Laramie River to reduce the chance of contamination and construction of an underground slurry wall to isolate the wastes and prevent the spread of contamination. Additional work to remove and isolate the sources of contamination will be completed by 2005.]]></description>

In 1995, a flock of migrating snow geese landed in the Berkeley Pit water and died. A total of 342 carcasses were recovered.[3]  ARCO, the custodian of the pit, denied that the toxic water caused the death of the geese, attributing the deaths to an acute aspergillosis infection that may have been caused by a grain fungus, as substantiated by Colorado State. 

University necropsy findings. These findings were disputed by the State of Montana on the basis of its own lab tests.[3]  Necropsies showed their insides were lined with burns and festering sores from exposure to high concentrations of copper, cadmium, and arsenic.[1]                                                         
The most recent development in the clean-up was the construction of a treatment plant on Horseshoe Bend. This facility treats and diverts water coming from the Horseshoe Bend flow. In addition, it will be able to treat the existing Berkeley Pit water in 2018, or whenever the water level hits the critical point of 5,410 feet (1,650 m) above sea level. This number was set by federal order and is intended to protect the ground water from being contaminated by the water in the pit.
The Berkeley Pit is on the federal Superfund site list.]]></description>

Brazil once had the highest deforestation rate in the world and as of 2005 still has the largest area of forest that is removed annually.[1]  Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000 sq mi) of Amazon rainforest have been destroyed. In 2012, the Amazon was approximately 5.4 million square kilometres, which is only 87% of the Amazon’s original state.[2]  

Rainforests have decreased in size primarily due to deforestation. Despite reductions in the rate of deforestation in the last ten years, the Amazon Rainforest will be reduced by 40% by 2030 at the current rate.[3]  Between May 2000 and August 2006, Brazil lost nearly 150,000 square kilometres of forest, an area larger than that of Greece. According to the Living Planet Report 2010, deforestation is continuing at an alarming rate, but at the CBD 9th Conference 67 ministers signed up to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.[4]  ]]></description>

Millions of tons of mill tailings, mine waste rock, and ore concentrates are spread across the site. Mining contamination has affected more than 166 river miles of the Coeur d’Alene River corridor, adjacent floodplains, downstream water bodies, tributaries and fill areas. The risks are not hypothetical or potential future risks.

The site was operated by Burlington Northern Railroad and historical usage included railroad tie treatment, loading and unloading of ties and timbers, and timber storage. Several rail lines are still active through the area. The tie treating plant operated on the property between 1907 and 1985 and treated railroad ties with creosote and fuel oil. Wastewater generated from the wood-treating process was sent to two shallow, unlined ponds. This created a sludge which contaminated both the underlying soils and the groundwater with creosote and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).]]></description>

			<name>China's 'Kill a Sparrow' campaign results in starvation of 20 million people</name>
			<ExtendedData>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign)

The campaign against the 'Four Pests' was initiated in 1958 as a hygiene campaign by Mao Zedong, who identified the need to exterminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows. Sparrows – mainly the Eurasian Tree Sparrow[1][2] – were included on the list because they ate grain seeds, robbing the people of the fruits of their labour. The masses of China were mobilized to eradicate the birds, and citizens took to banging pots and pans or beating drums to scare the birds from landing, forcing them to fly until they fell from the sky in exhaustion. Sparrow nests were torn down, eggs were broken, and nestlings were killed.[1][3] Sparrows and other birds were shot down from the sky, resulting in the near-extinction of the birds in China.[4] Non-material rewards and recognition were offered to schools, work units and government agencies in accordance with the volume of pests they had killed.

By April 1960, Chinese leaders realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects, as well as grains.[3][2] Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased.[1][2] Mao ordered the end of the campaign against sparrows, replacing them with bed bugs in the ongoing campaign against the Four Pests.[3] By this time, however, it was too late. With no sparrows to eat them, locust populations ballooned, swarming the country and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the Great Leap Forward, including widespread deforestation and misuse of poisons and pesticides.[1] Ecological imbalance is credited with exacerbating the Great Chinese Famine, in which at least 20 million people died of starvation.[5][6]]]></description>

Residents of the surrounding community alleged that pollution from the plant leached into the groundwater and caused increased rates of cancer amongst other health problems. Arsenic, boron, cadmium, lead and other dangerous chemicals were detected in residential wells surrounding the plant. The federal Environmental Protection Agency cautioned state officials about potential health risks associated with leaky equipment and corroded stacks allowing underwater leaching and spills from Coronet, but residents were not notified of ongoing problems with the company's lack of environmental controls. The state Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Struhs expressed concern over "potential systemic problems that prevented the situation from being identified and corrected sooner" in the Tampa office of the DEP. Legislation requiring the state of Florida to notify area residents in such events was proposed.]]></description>

At least 13 fires have been reported on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868.[12] The largest river fire in 1952 caused over $1 million in damage to boats and a riverfront office building.[13] Fires erupted on the river several times between the 1952 fire and June 22, 1969, when a river fire that day captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that "oozes rather than flows" and in which a person "does not drown but decays".[14]The fire did eventually spark major changes as well as the article from Time, but in the immediate aftermath very little attention was given to the incident. Furthermore, the conflagration that sparked Time's outrage was in June 1969, but the pictures they displayed on the cover and as part of the article were from the much more dangerous 1952 fire. No pictures from the 1969 fire are known to exist.[15]]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_River)

In 2014, tens of thousands of tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of contaminated water spilled into the Dan River near Eden, NC from a closed North Carolina coal-fired power plant that is owned by Duke Energy. It is currently the third worst coal ash spill ever to happen in the United States.[3][4] A 48-inch (120 cm) pipe spilled arsenic and other heavy metals into the river for a week, but was successfully plugged by Duke. The federal government plans to investigate, and people along the river have been warned to stay away from the water. Fish have yet to be tested,[5] but health officials say not to eat them. Cities in Virginia which use the river say that with standard methods of treatment, the water is safe to drink. Ash is found on the bottom of the river for 70 miles (110 km) and is as much as 5 feet (150 cm) deep in places. Late in February, North Carolina regulators cited Duke for the violations at the plant on the river. On March 3, in addition to citing Duke for similar problems elsewhere in the state, North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources called the spill on the Dan River an "environmental disaster."[6]]]></description>

CHARLESTON, W.Va.

Earl Ray Tomblin declaring a state of emergency Thursday for all those areas.

The chemical, a foaming agent used in the coal preparation process, leaked from a tank at Freedom Industries, overran a containment area and went into the river earlier Thursday. The amount that spilled wasn't immediately known, but West Virginia American Water has a treatment plant nearby and it is the company's customers who are affected.]]></description>

The waters of the Gulf are dead. Industrial pollution has led to the ecological destruction. The stench of ammonia hangs in the air; a thick, black brew bubbles up from a sewer and then flows right into the sea.

Gabes' coastal waters are loaded with phosphogypsum, a toxic, slightly radioactive byproduct of the phosphate refining process. Phosphate rock is processed in industrial plants to make phosphoric acids for use in the agriculture fertilizer and food preservative industries.]]></description>

The watchstanders at Coast Guard Sector Houston/Galveston received a call around 12:35 p.m. from the captain of the 585-foot bulk carrier Summer Wind, reporting a collision. The barge contained 924,000 gallons of fuel oil, towed by the motor vessel Miss Susan.

The Coast Guard didn't give an estimate of how much fuel had spilled into the bay, but there was a visible sheen of oil at the scene.

Officials believe only one of the barge's tanks was breached, with a capacity of 168,000 gallons.]]></description>

The Goiânia accident was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 13, 1987, at Goiânia, in the Brazilian state of Goiás after an old radiotherapy source was stolen from an abandoned hospital site in the city. It was subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination and 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their body.[1][2] In the cleanup operation, topsoilhad to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. Time magazine has identified the accident as one of the world's "worst nuclear disasters" and the International Atomic Energy Agency called it "one of the world's worst radiological incidents".[3][4]]]></description>

The Great Smog of '52 or Big Smoke[1]  was a severe air pollution event that affected London during December 1952. A period of cold weather, combined with an anticyclone and windless conditions, collected airborne pollutants mostly from the use of coal to form a thick layer of smog over the city. It lasted from Friday 5 to Tuesday 9 December 1952, and then dispersed quickly after a change of weather.]]></description>

Currently, the Gulf of Mexico's dead zone, off the coast of Louisiana and Texas,[14] is the largest hypoxic zone in the United States.[15] The Mississippi River which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a NOAA 2009 fact sheet, "Seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin"[16] which includes the heart of U.S.agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of potassium and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year. Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans and large lakes, caused by "excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water.]]></description>

Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of gyres and on coastlines,[1] frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.

The Mount Polley mine disaster is an environmental disaster in the Cariboo region of British Columbia, Canada, that began in the early morning of 4 August 2014[1] when the Mount Polley tailings pond partially breached, releasing 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres[1] of slurry into Polley Lake.[2] The tailings pond covers four square kilometres and by 8 August according to Brian Kynoch, president of Imperial Metals, [2] the owner of the Mount Polley copper and gold mine,[3] the tailings pond was "virtually empty."[3][1] The contaminated slurry carrying felled trees, mud and debris "scoured away the banks" of Hazeltine Creek which flows out of Polley Lake and continued into the nearby Quesnel Lake. The spill caused Polley Lake to rise by 1.5 metres (4.9 ft).[3] Hazeltine Creek was transformed from a 2-metre-wide (6.6 ft) stream to a 50-metre-across (160 ft) "wasteland."[4] Cariboo Creek was also affected.[1] The spill has been called one of the biggest environmental disasters in modern Canadian history.[5][6][7]]]></description>

Imperial Refining was an inactive and abandoned crude oil refining facility that operated from 1917 until 1934 when it declared bankruptcy. Waste piles were found onsite and were characterized as dry, asphaltlike tar mats associated with oil-contaminated soil on top of oil-stained clay. The contaminants of concern are PAHs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) and metals, primarily Benzo(a)pyrene and arsenic. An estimated 130 residents live within 200 feet of the facility and an estimated 23,427 individuals live within four miles of the facility.]]></description>

The Indian Bend Wash area is a Superfund cleanup site in Scottsdale and Tempe, Arizona. It was declared a Superfund site in 1983 after industrial solvents were discovered to have contaminated the groundwater in an approximately 13-square-mile (34 km2) area. It is one of the largest EPA sites in terms of volume of groundwater treated, estimated at 61.3 billion US gallons (232,000,000 m3).[1]  During the 1960s, it was typical for companies to dispose industrial solvents directly into the ground and into dry wells.  In 1981, volatile organic compounds (VOC) were detected in Tempe and Scottsdale city wells, including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and chloroform. The wells were shut down immediately, and the area was declared a Superfund site in 1983. Potentially responsible parties.

Motorola, Siemens, GlaxoSmithKline, along with several smaller companies, have paid for the approximately $100 million in cleanup costs. Cleanup has consisted of several stations that pump and treat groundwater.]]></description>

The TVA Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill occurred just before 1 a.m. on Monday December 22, 2008, when an ash dike ruptured at an 84-acre (0.34 km2) solid waste containment area at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee, USA.  1.1 billion US gallons (4,200,000 m3) of coal fly ash slurry was released. The coal-fired power plant, located across the Clinch River from the city of Kingston, uses ponds to dewater the fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, which is then stored in wet form in dredge cells. The slurry (a mixture of fly ash and water) traveled across the Emory River and its Swan Pond embayment, on to the opposite shore, covering up to 300 acres (1.2 km2) of the surrounding land, damaging homes and flowing up and down stream in nearby waterways such as the Emory River and Clinch River (tributaries of the Tennessee River). It was the largest fly ash release in United States history.]]></description>

The largest and oldest vermiculite mine in the United States was started in the 1920s, at Libby, Montana, and the vermiculite was sold under the commercial name Zonolite. The Zonolite brand and the mine was acquired by the W.R. Grace Company in 1963. Mining operations at the Libby site stopped in 1990 in response to asbestos contamination. While in operation, the Libby mine may have produced 80% of the world's supply of vermiculite.[4]]]></description>

The Lindsay Manufacturing Company generated sulfuric acid waste from a galvanizing process at its plant. The wastes were discharged into an unlined pond for 10 years. Use of the pond ceased in 1983, when three monitoring wells showed contamination. In addition, chlorinated solvents associated with metal parts cleaning and degreasing were discharged to the ground at the Lindsay property, releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the environment which subsequently migrated into the ground water beneath the facility. The site is surrounded by agricultural land. Ground water is used for agricultural purposes, and as a drinking water supply for nearby residents. Approximately 3,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site, with the nearest residence located 300 feet away.]]></description>

From 1963 to 1977 the Maxey Flat Low Level Radioactive Waste facility served as a dump for 832 corporations and government agencies. On September 27, 1982, the Kentucky New Era reported that the Maxey Flat disposal site was being closed due to "radioactive leakage". Although no immediate health hazard was reported, "the potential [was] still there". State Natural Resources Coordinator Jackie Swigart confirmed that radioactive material had escaped burial trenches and been detected beyond the borders of the 250 acre site. The geology of the Maxey Flat area may contribute to the inadvertent spread of radioactive materials beyond the site's boundaries underground.]]></description>

Minamata disease was first discovered in Minamata  city in Kumamoto prefecture, in 1956. It was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from the Chisso Corporation's chemical factory, which continued from 1932 to 1968. This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated in shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which when eaten by the local populace resulted in mercury poisoning. While cat, dog, pig, and human deaths continued for 36 years, the government and company did little to prevent the pollution. The animal effects were severe enough in cats that they came to be called "dancing cat fever."[1]  ]]></description>

Thousands of fish — gasping desperately, then floating lifelessly — surfaced in Honolulu Harbor this week, suffering from oxygen deprivation caused by a massive molasses spill. This strange case of sugary suffocation was brought on by the Matson Shipping Company, which was loading one of its vessels with 1,600 tons of molasses through a pipeline in the harbor early Monday morning when a leak sprung.

Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining that involves the mining of the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Excess rock and soil laden with toxic mining byproducts are often dumped into nearby valleys, in what are called "holler fills" or "valley fills." 
 
Peer-reviewed studies show that mountaintop mining has serious environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity and toxification of watersheds, that mitigation practices cannot successfully address.[5]  There are also adverse human health impacts which result from contact with affected streams or exposure to airborne toxins and dust.[5]  According to 21 scientific studies there has been major effects on the population in the Appalachia where MTM takes place including over 50% higher cancer rates, 42% higher birth defect rates, and $75 billion a year in public health costs from pollution.

Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of gyres and on coastlines,[1] frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.

Oil spills are a common event in Nigeria [9] and occur due to a number of causes, including: corrosion of pipeline and tankers (accounting for 50% of all spills), sabotage (28%), and oil production operations (21%), with 1% of the spills being accounted for by inadequate or non-functional production equipment. Oil spillage has a major impact on the ecosystem into which it is released and may constitute ecocide. Immense tracts of the mangrove forests, which are especially susceptible to oil (mainly because it is stored in the soil and re-released annually during inundations), have been destroyed. An estimated 5 to 10% of Nigerian mangrove ecosystems have been wiped out either by settlement] or oil. The rainforest which previously occupied some 7,400 km² of land has disappeared as well.[6]  ]]></description>

Approximately 178 barrels of crude oil — about 7,500 gallons — were spilled Friday afternoon from a storage tank into the Poudre River.

According to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the cause of the spill, east-southeast of Windsor, was spring flood waters undercutting a bank, causing the tank to drop downward and damaging a valve. This allowed oil to escape from that broken valve.

The tank is operated by Noble Energy. The company discovered the leak and reported it to authorities.]]></description>

The massive civil and military use of nuclear power since the 1950s has also damaged the regional environment. Most of the Soviet Union’s nuclear tests (over a hundred from 1955 to 1990) were carried out on Novaya Zemlya, and large quantities of solid and liquid radioactive waste were dumped in the Barents and Kara Seas. The northern fleet, which includes nuclear-powered icebreakers and nuclear submarines (sometimes without nuclear warheads but still driven by nuclear reactors), is stationed at bases along the northern coast of the Kola Peninsula, near Murmansk. The nuclear power station at Polyarnyy is classified as "dangerous" by the International Atomic Energy Agency. As if this were not enough, the Soviet Union detonated nuclear charges for civil engineering and mining purposes on at least twenty occasions from 1969 to 1988. Few of these activities are mentioned in official reports, and very little is known of the extent of radioactive contamination in the region.]]></description>

The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. In addition to these well-known stratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Consider the heat-retaining characteristics of plastic and those plastic particles discovered floating on the top of vast sections of our oceans; and that plastic has only existed in our waste over the last 60+ years. These plastic particles, essentially acting like a plastic heat-retaining swimming pool cover or food service container, stretch from California to Japan in the Pacific Ocean as well as other oceans. The sun's radiation helps to break down the plastic into micron-sized particles creating a plastic soup. Since Styrofoam has a thermal conductivity of 0.010 and water has a thermal conductivity of 0.20, the plastic reduces the ability of the water to transfer its heat energy to the air. This France-sized heat cover in the Pacific may act like an artificial El Niño or La Niña; affecting our weather, the ocean's oscillation, wild life survival, the poisoning of our food chain and could have accelerated global warming way beyond that of CO2 emissions. 

In the last decade, researchers worldwide have noted an increase in the temperature of our oceans and had attributed it to CO2 emissions. But what if they are wrong and there is more to it? What if it is our plastic waste that is causing the ocean temperature to rise? What if the energy of this circulating super-heated seawater is transferred to CO2 conditioned air through the non-plastic affected sections of the oceans?]]></description>

Plant operations have contaminated the site over time. The primary contamination of concern is trichloroethylene  (TCE), which was a commonly used degreaser at the site. TCE leaked and contaminated groundwater on and off the site. The groundwater is also contaminated with trace amounts of technetium, a radioactive fission product; other contaminates include polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs). Through normal operations, portions of the plant are contaminated with uranium.                                                                              
In 1988, TCE and trace amounts of technetium-99 was found in the drinking water wells of residences located near the plant site in McCracken County, Kentucky. To protect human health the Department of Energy provided city water, at no cost, to the affected residents and continues to do so. The Department of Energy is using electrical resistance heating, ET-DSP(trademarked) to vaporize the TCE from the groundwater. This clean up action began in mid-2010. Much of the contamination of the actual plant will not be cleaned up until the plant ceases operations.]]></description>

The EPA added the Upper Tenmile Creek Mining Area to the Superfund National Priorities List on October 22, 1999, due to mining waste problems in the 53-square-mile watershed ... The Upper Tenmile Creek Mining Area site is located in the Rimini Mining District, southwest of Helena, Montana. It consists of numerous abandoned and inactive hard-rock mine sites that produced gold, lead, zinc and copper. Mining began in the district before 1870 and continued through the 1920s. Little mining has been performed there since the early 1930s ... The site includes the drainage basin of Tenmile Creek upstream of the Helena water treatment plant and includes tributaries that supply water to the plant's five intake pipelines. EPA identified 150 individual mine sites within the watershed boundary, of which 70 have been prioritized for cleanup. Many of these mine features are above the five City of Helena drinking water intakes, which supply about 50 percent of the city's water.]]></description>

The Rocky Mountain Arsenal contained a deep injection well that was constructed in 1961.[4] It was drilled to a depth of 12,045 feet (3671 m). The well was cased and sealed to a depth of 11,975 feet (3650 m), with the remaining 70 feet (21 m) left as an open hole for the injection of Basin F liquids. For testing purposes, the well was injected with approximately 568,000 US gallons (2150 m³) of city water prior to injecting any waste. The injected fluids had very little potential for reaching the surface or usable groundwater supply since the injection point had 11,900 feet (3630 m) of rock above it and was sealed at the opening. The Army discontinued use of the well in February 1966 because the fluid injection triggered a series of earthquakes in the area.[4][5]The well remained unused until 1985 when the Army permanently sealed the disposal well.]]></description>

On 4 July 1961, under the command of Captain First Rank Nikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev, K-19 was conducting exercises in the North Atlantic close to Southern Greenland when it developed a major leak in its reactor coolant system, causing the water pressure in the aft reactor to drop to zero and causing failure of the coolant pumps. A separate accident had disabled the long-range radio system, so they could not contact Moscow. The reactor temperature rose uncontrollably, reaching 800 °C (1,470 °F) – almost the melting point of the fuel rods and the chain reactions continued [citation needed] despite the control rods being inserted via a SCRAM mechanism. The reactor continued to heat up as coolant is still required during shutdown until the reactions decrease. Despite Zateyev's and others' earlier requests, no backup cooling system had been installed.]]></description>

This introduction gave rise to an environmental disaster, with the rats causing the extinction of several of the island’s endemic birds and other fauna in the next few years through predation, as well as causing hardship to the islanders by raiding their crops and only export commodity, the seeds of the Kentia Palm. Problems with the rats led to an attempted ecological solution through the deliberate introduction of Tasmanian Masked Owls between 1922 and 1930 to the island, an action which compounded the disaster by adding another predator to the ecosystem]]></description>

Crews vacuumed oil that had leaked from the Mid-Valley pipeline into a wetland area of the Oak Glen Nature Preserve, 20 miles (32 km) north of Cincinnati, according to local officials.

The 240-barrel (10,000-gallons/38,000-liter) spill has been contained, Sunoco said in a statement.

The leak was discovered at 8:20 p.m. EDT on Monday (0020 GMT Tuesday) and the line was shut around 1 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, Sunoco said. It was unclear if any oil was still spewing from the pipe.

The spill did not appear to have reached the Great Miami River, about a quarter of a mile (400 meters) away, though tests were still being completed, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.]]></description>

Federal government investigators subsequently found that air samples from the area had elevated levels of fibrous tremolite asbestos, which is suspected to have caused asbestos related ailments among current and former Zonolite employees, along with non-mine employees. [14]  More than 274 area deaths in the past 60 years are suspected to have been caused by asbestos contaminated vermiculite.

Although the spill following a fire on June 28 at the Statoil North America well pad in Monroe County stretched 5 miles along the creek and killed more than 70,000 fish and wildlife, state officials said they do not believe drinking water was affected.

But environmental advocacy groups said they wonder how the state can be sure.

The development of levees in the Louisiana Delta to protect the growth of human development in the area cut off the Mississippi river from its delta. As a result the delta has been quickly drying out, decomposing and sinking due to the lack of new sediment and freshwater, and the development of more than 10,000 miles of canals and pipelines to service a network of 50,000 oil and gas wells vital to our economy. In as few as 80 years, 2,000 square miles of delta disappeared into the Gulf of Mexico. Check out this interactive presentation by Propublica.org  to see just how serious the situation has become and how it could affect 50% of our energy resources and the national economy.]]></description>

			<name>Thousands Of Gallons Of Oil Were Dumped Into Newtown Creek This Summer</name>

The bed of Newtown Creek is 15 feet thick and made of "black mayonnaise" from the millions of gallons of oil and chemicals that have spilled into its waters since the mid-19th century. But just because it's a Superfund site doesn't mean Newtown Creek can afford to take any more human abuse. The Times reports that someone has been dumping a whole lot of oil into the waterway over the past few weeks.

Last week, DEC received an anonymous tip claiming that the oil was coming from the Borden Avenue Bridge, just south of the LIE and east of Long Island City on Dutch Kills.

Investigators conducted surveillance and found a giant oil truck marked Cobra Scrap Waste Oil parked near the bridge, disgorging its contents into a drain, the driver nowhere to be found.]]></description>

SHANGHAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Severe pollution in Beijing has made the Chinese capital "barely suitable" for living, according to an official Chinese report, as the world's second largest economy tries to reduce often hazardous levels of smog caused by decades of rapid growth.

Pollution is a rising concern for China's stability-obsessed leaders, keen to douse potential unrest as affluent city dwellers turn against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has tainted much of the country's air, water and soil.

The report, by the Beijing-based Social Science Academic Press and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, ranked the Chinese capital second worst out of 40 global cities for its environmental conditions, official media reported on Thursday.]]></description>

Fishermen and the environment of Niger Delta continue to suffer the consequences of a massive Shell oil spill in the Niger Delta - one of the worst in years. The oil giant says 1,200 barrels had been recovered as of Tuesday. Traveling to the affected areas of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, Reuters witnessed the devastation in the delta which covers 20,000 km² within wetlands of 70,000 km²
