On November 13, locals saw what they described as “fiery rain” falling to the ground. When the glowing masses struck the ground, they turned into “lumps of jelly”. The lumps were said to be transparent and became round, flattened masses when they landed. Within hours, the jelly disintegrated and became a pile of small white particles that crumbled into dust when touched.]]></description>

It's Raining Fish! (http://www.xprojectmagazine.com/archives/strange/fishrain.html) 
 
I was startled by something falling all over me-down my neck, on my head, and on my back. On putting my hand down my neck I was surprised to find they were little fish. By this time I saw the whole ground covered with them. I took off my hat, the brim of which was full of them. They were jumping all about. They covered the ground in a long strip of about 80 yards by 12, as we measured afterwards.

Having examined the animals, I recognized them as Slarias battrachi, a species of catfish which is very abundant in fresh water in Singapore, and in the Malayan Penisnsula. They were from 25-30 centimeters long and therefore adult.]]></description>
