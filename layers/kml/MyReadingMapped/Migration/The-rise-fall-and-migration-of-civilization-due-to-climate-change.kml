Wars, Murders to Rise Due to Global Warming? (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130801-global-warming-violence-climate-change-science-environment/)

Wars, murders, and other acts of violence will likely become more commonplace in coming decades as the effects of global warming cause tempers to flare worldwide, a comprehensive new study warns.

The research, detailed in this week's issue of the journal Science, synthesizes findings scattered across diverse fields ranging from archaeology to economics to paint a clearer picture of how global warming-related shifts in temperature and rainfall could fuel acts of aggression.

Though scientists don't know exactly why global warming increases violence, the findings suggest that it's another major fallout of human-made climate change, in addition to rising sea levels and increased heat waves.

"This study shows that the value of reducing [greenhouse gas] emissions is actually higher than we previously thought," said study first author Solomon Hsiang, an economist at Princeton University in New Jersey. (Related: "Global Warming Making People More Aggressive?")]]></description>

The 4,000 abstacts were from papers published in the past 21 years that stated a position on the cause of recent global warming – 97 percent of these endorsed the consensus that we are seeing man-made, or anthropogenic, global warming (AGW). You won't find more than 3% of evolutionary biologists denying evolution either, but the paper in Environmental Research Letters also asked the authors of the papers to rate their entire paper using the same criteria. Over 2,000 papers were self-rated and among those that discussed the cause of recent global warming, 97 percent endorsed the consensus that it is caused by humans.]]></description>

Migration: From drought to flooding? (http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/52223)

Around five million to 15 million migrants left drylands across most developing countries in most decades, the team found. All regions except North America saw high levels of out-migration from mountain regions, especially in Asia, where more than 30 million people moved away from mountainous areas in the 1990s. Almost all coastal regions, on the other hand, saw a net influx. Asia topped the table with more than 18 million net migrants to the coast in each decade, and more than 60 million in the 1990s, a period when many Chinese people moved to industrial cities on the coast.

On average in low income countries 5.1 million people per decade migrated away from the highest-risk drought areas. But around 150,000 people per decade moved into cyclone-prone areas and around seven million per decade into areas at high risk of flooding.]]></description>

Blue Nile incision on the Ethiopian Plateau: Pulsed plateau growth, Pliocene uplift, and hominin evolution,  Page 10  
 
East African aridification caused a gradual replacement of closed forest woodlands by open savanna grasslands. Darwin (1871, as cited in Potts, 1998) pioneered the “Savanna Hypothesis” by suggesting, in summary, that human evolution was a consequence of adaptive change on the African savanna. Hence, it is possible that the massive uplift of the Ethiopian Plateau in the Pliocene was critical in the origin, adaptation, and/or demise of East African hominins, particularly forcing an arid-adaptive evolutionary path for Homo sapiens (e.g., Reed, 1997; deMenocal, 1995).]]></description>

How Early Humans Migrated into Europe: The Origins of Our Ancient Ancestors

In the end, the researchers found new evidence that indicated early humans migrated into Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum, a time in Earth's history when the ice sheets were at their maximum extension between 26,500 and 19,000 years ago. However, this migration occurred before Neolithic times, a period also referred to as the New Stone age that was known for the development of human technology. This gives scientists a clearer picture of how early humans were developing at this time.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather_events_of_535%E2%80%93536)

The extreme weather events of 535–536 were the most severe and protracted short-term episodes of cooling in the Northern Hemisphere in the last 2,000 years.[1] The event is thought to have been caused by an extensive atmospheric dust veil, possibly resulting from a large volcanic eruption in the tropics,[2] or debris from space impacting the Earth.[3] Its effects were widespread, causing unseasonal weather, crop failures, and famines worldwide.[3]

 The Gaelic Irish Annals[6][7][8] record the following:

- "A failure of bread in the year 536 AD" - the Annals of Ulster                                                                   
- "A failure of bread from the years 536–539 AD" - the Annals of Inisfallen Further phenomena reported by a number of independent contemporary sources:

- Low temperatures, even snow during the summer (snow reportedly fell in August in China, which caused the harvest there to be delayed)[9]                
- Crop failures[10]                                                            
- "A dense, dry fog" in the Middle East, China, and Europe[9]                                                                                 
- Drought in Peru, which affected the Moche culture[9][11]]]></description>

The Chicxulub crater is a prehistoric impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula  in Mexico Its center is located where is location placemarker is. The impact would have caused some of the largest mega tsunamis in Earth's history. A cloud of super-heated dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second.[24] Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry, broiling the Earth's surface and possibly igniting wildfires; meanwhile, colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate  rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically.Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity  (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.[29]  A long-term effect of the impact was the creation of the sedimentary basin which "ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce."[30]  ]]></description>

Why societies collapse. (http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/07/17/2858655.htm)

When the drought came in 1117 it was a couple of decades before the end. Pueblo Benito was a big, six storey, unwalled plaza, until about 20 years before the end, when a high wall went up around the plaza. And when you see a rich place without a wall, you can safely infer that the rich place was on good terms with its poor neighbours, and when you see a wall going up around the rich place, you can infer that there was now trouble with the neighbours. So probably what was happening was that towards the end, in the drought, as the landscape is filled up, the people out on the periphery were no longer satisfied because the people in the religious and political centre were no longer delivering the goods. The prayers to the gods were not bringing rain, there was stuff to redistribute and they began making trouble. Chaco Canyon was eventually abandoned. The Anasazi had committed themselves irreversibly to a complex society, and once that society collapsed, they couldn't rebuild it because again they deforested their environment.
 
In the Anasazi case we have the interaction of environmental impact and climate change.]]></description>

- Location: Upper Egypt
- Accomplishments: Art, Architecture, Mythology
- The End: Right before the collapse of Egypt’s Old Kingdom, King Pepy II ruled for 90 years. In the 20 years after his death, 18 different rulers briefly held the title before the institution fell apart. The cause of the collapse remains mysterious, but Egyptologist Dr. Fekri Hassan has argued that the disintegration of the society was caused by reduced flows in the Nile River. This drought lasted several years. A study of dust deposits from the Kajemarum Oasis in Nigeria revealed a short-lived cold-climate event that corresponds to this period.]]></description>

Can the severe environmental downturn in the mid-12th century BC be implicated in the cause of the Greek Dark Age? By Mike Baillie, Queen’s University Belfast  

Page 3 -The existence of an 18-year-long growth downturn (1159-1141 BC) in Irish bog oaks has served to focus attention on the mid-12th century BC. The environmental effect can be traced in other tree-ring chronologies and may have been at least hemispheric in extent. In searching for possible causes it is notable that both the Chinese and the Greeks have seminal 'battles', namely the Battle of Mu and the Battle of Troy, both set traditionally in the 12th century BC. What singles out these 'battles' is that both, independently, involve supernatural beings (sky gods?) and mortals. An obvious question is whether there is a message in these clearly unreal 'battles'? To state the question: do these ancient stories hint that there was a cosmic cause for the mid-12th century environmental events? This paper will review the evidence for the 1159-1141 BC environmental event and explore what its effects may have been.]]></description>

China’s Han dynasty, from which the ethnic majority of modern-day China derive their name, lasted from 206 BC to 260 AD, also enjoyed its classical period during the same period as the Augustan Era and collapsed during the same a period of declining precipitation as Rome. Its collapse also occurred as a result of invading barbarians from the north (Huang et al.).]]></description>

Climate Change Led to Collapse of Ancient Indus Civilization, Study Finds (http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=117456&tid=3622&cid=138489)
 
A new study combining the latest archaeological evidence with state-of-the-art geoscience technologies provides evidence that climate change was a key ingredient in the collapse of the great Indus or Harappan Civilization almost 4000 years ago. The study also resolves a long-standing debate over the source and fate of the Sarasvati, the sacred river of Hindu mythology.

Archaeological evidence supports the Ghaggar-Hakra as the location of intensive settlement during Harappan times. The new geological evidence—sediments, topography— shows that rivers were indeed sizable and highly active in this region, but most likely due to strong monsoons. However, there is no evidence of wide incised valleys like along the Indus and its tributaries and researchers did not find any cut-through, incised connections to either of the two nearby Himalayan-fed rivers of Sutlej and Yamuna. The new study argues that these crucial differences prove that the Sarasvati (Ghaggar-Hakra) was not Himalayan-fed, but a perennial monsoon-supported watercourse, and that aridification reduced it to short seasonal flows.]]></description>

Throughout history, natural disasters and environmental change have often been the cause of migration, and the war/raiding that is sometimes associated with it. The “Sea Peoples” of the Bronze Age function as a good example. They were essentially a loose confederacy of seafaring raiders from southern Europe that raided and invaded Egypt, Anatolia, Syria, Canaan, and Cyprus, and were responsible for the destruction of multiple civilizations, such as the Hittite Empire. It’s been well noted that they weren’t simply a military group, their ships housed women and children also. Very interestingly, recent research has shown that the date at which they are first mentioned in Egyptian writings nearly coincides with a very large eruption of the Santorini volcano (estimated between 1660-1613 BC). “The eruption and its aftermath (fires, tsunami, weather changes and famines) would have had wide-ranging effects across the Mediterranean, the Levant and particularly Greece, and could have provided the impetus for invasions of other regions of the Mediterranean.”]]></description>

However, by the middle of the 1st millennium, the Mayan’s were facing multi-year droughts which correspond to the low period in the tree-rings from Figure 4 which may have ultimately contributed to its demise (Haug et al).

Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed by Jared Diamond (http://homepage.eircom.net/~odyssey/Quotes/Life/Science/Collapse.html#8)

The end of the Greenland Norse colony is often described as a 'mystery'. That's true, but only partly so, because we need to distinguish ultimate reasons (i.e. underlying long-term factors behind the slow decline of Greenland Norse society) from proximate reasons (i.e. the final blow to the weakened society, killing the last individuals or forcing them to abandon their settlements). Only the proximate reasons remain partly mysterious; the ultimate reasons are clear. They consist of five sets of factors: Norse impact on the enviroment, climate change, decline in friendly contact with Norway, increase in hostile contact with the Inuit, and the conservative outlook of the Norse.
Between 1400 and 1420 the climate in the North Atlantic became colder and stormier, and mentions of ship traffic to Greenland cease... our last definite written notices of Norse Greenland are laconic accounts of burning at the stake, insanity and marriage — just the usual goings-on for any medieval European Christain society and give no hint of trouble.]]></description>

Climate Induced Migration and Conflict: historical evidence, and likely future outlook,  By Ed Chen 
 
The Shang dynasty lasted for about 500 years from 1600 BC to 1100 BC. However, the Shang were overthrown by an invading Zhou culture who originated from the Loess Steps of central china. Circa 1100 BC, there was a major drought in China, shown by high resolution soil sediment data. This led to famine which ultimately led to a southward migration of the Zhou people, as well as internal disorder within the Shang Dynasty (Huang et al.).]]></description>

In fact, the collapse of the Tang Dynasty coincides with that of the Mayan civilization—both due to extreme drought. "We have demonstrated that the cave record correlates well with many other records, including the Little Ice Age in Europe, temperature changes [across the] Northern Hemisphere, and major solar variability," Cheng notes.

Fluctuations in the sun's intensity in the past seemed to play the key role in determining the strength of the Asian monsoon. The record revealed over the past 50 years, however, paints a different picture, with man-made soot and greenhouse gases determining the rains' strength.]]></description>

Climate change and the rise and fall of civilizations

Once surrounded by mighty towers that eventually sunk into the sand, Ubar is just one in a growing list of ancient sites that are emerging with help from satellite imagery. Also known as “remote sensing data”, images taken from high above the surface of the Earth can show subtle signs of long-lost societies that are impossible to see from the ground.
 
Wikipedia
 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iram_of_the_Pillars)                    
In the early 1990s a team lead by amateur archaeologist and film maker Nicholas Clapp and adventurer Ranulph Fiennes, archaeologist Juris Zarins and lawyer George Hedges announced that they had found Ubar.[3] The conclusion they reached, based on site excavations at the site of a Bedouin well at Shisr in Dhofar province, Oman, and an inspection of NASA satellite photographs, was that this was the site of Ubar, or Iram of the Pillars, the name for an ancient city destroyed by a natural disaster.[4]

When interviewed by PBS for their Nova in 1996 Zarins said they had found the lost city of Ubar. Later Zarins concluded that Shisr did not represent a city called Ubar[5] and in a 2000 publication he suggested that modern Habarut may be the site of Ubar.[6]

In 2002 geology professor H Stewart Edgell reported that the NASA data used by the team was misleading and that the site was simply an isolated waterhole, and that the alleged fortress was a small building used by a few families at most.[7]]]></description>

These periods of strong and weak rains, when compared with Chinese historical records, coincide with periods of imperial turmoil or prosperity, as in the case of the expansion of the Northern Song Dynasty—a time of abundant harvests. Further, the stalagmite record matches those of glacial retreat in the Alps, sediment records from Lake Huguang Maar in southern China and droughts from Barbados to Southern France.]]></description>

During the post-MWP cooling of the climate, glaciers in many parts of Europe began to advance. Glaciers negatively influenced almost every aspect of life for those unfortunate enough to be living in their path. Glacial advances throughout Europe destroyed farmland and caused massive flooding. On many occasions bishops and priests were called to bless the fields and to pray that the ice stopped grinding forward (Bryson, 1977.) Various tax records show glaciers over the years destroying whole towns caught in their path. A few major advances, as noted by Ladurie (1971), appear below:

1595: Gietroz (Switzerland) glacier advances, dammed Dranse River, and caused flooding of Bagne with 70 deaths.

1600-10: Advances by Chamonix (France) glaciers cause massive floods which destroyed three villages and severely damaged a fourth. One village had stood since the 1200's. 

1670-80's: Maximum historical advances by glaciers in eastern Alps. Noticeable decline of human population by this time in areas close to glaciers, whereas population elsewhere in Europe had risen.
1695-1709:	Iceland glaciers advance dramatically, destroying farms.

1710-1735:	A glacier in Norway was advancing at a rate of 100 m per year for 25 years.

1748-50:	Norwegian glaciers achieved their historical maximum LIA positions.]]></description>

The researchers say the toolmakers at Jebel Faya may have reached the Arabian Peninsula at a time when changes in the climate were transforming it from arid desert into a grassland habitat with lakes and rivers.                                                                    
These human groups could later have moved on towards the Persian Gulf, trekking around the Iranian coast and on to South Asia.                                
Indeed, Dr Mike Petraglia at the University of Oxford has uncovered tools in India that he says could have been made by modern humans before 60,000 years ago. Some tools were sandwiched in ash from the eruption of the Toba super-volcano in Indonesia that geologists can date very accurately to 74,000 years ago.]]></description>

Previously, humans were believed to have migrated southward, from the East Asia mainland to Taiwan and then to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia . However, recent findings point to the submerged Sundaland as the probable cradle of Asian population: thus the "Out of Sundaland" theory.                                                                                      
A study from Leeds University and published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, examining mitochondrial DNA lineages, suggested that humans had been occupying the islands of Southeast Asia for a longer period than previously believed. Population dispersals seem to have occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.[4]  The population migrations were most likely to have been driven by climate change — the effects of the drowning of an ancient continent. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses may have caused flooding and the submerging of the Sunda continent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.]]></description>

Climate Change, Migration, and 
Conflict in the Amazon and the Andes (http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SouthAmericaClimateMigration.pdf)
 
For the Amazon and the Cerrado, shifting rainfall patterns and temperatures due to climate change will lead to more frequent droughts and forest fires in the dry season and floods in the rainy season,threatening the growth of monoculture agribusiness and small-hold farmers and ranchers. For the river communities of the Amazon, droughts can also undermine river transport and food security—essential to remote villages and towns. 
 
Climate change has also contributed to the rapid melting of the Andean glaciers, central to feeding the rivers and aquifers of the region and sustaining countless human settlements. Current projections predict that by 2050 up to 50 million people in the vast lowlands fed by Andean glacial melt will be affected by the loss of dry season water for drinking, agriculture, sanitation, and hydropower. Diminishing downriver water flow will also undermine hydropower, crucial to the economic health of the continent—Brazil, for example, derives 84 percent of its electricity from hydropower.
 
The Amazon region is one of the primary destinations of migratory flows in Brazil. Between 1991 and 2004, the population of the Amazon region increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, greater than the rest of Brazil, which as a whole grew at a 1.8 percent rate.61 Internally, migration to the Legal Amazon has increased. Manaus, a city of nearly 2 million people, has grown the most in the past decade and is now Brazil’s seventh-largest city, while Palmas, the capital of Tocatins, is believed to have had the highest growth among Brazil’s state capitals. The far western Amazonian state of Rondonia, meanwhile, showed 7.3 percent growth in 2011, the fastest among Brazil’s 26 states.62 Ten Amazonian cities have doubled in population over the past decade, and the region’s population climbed 23 percent from 2000 to 2010, roughly twice the national pace.]]></description>

DESERTIFICATION IN THE NEAR ARAL SEA REGION AND POPULATION 
MIGRATION
 
The drying of the Aral Sea bottom has sharply changed the environment to worse with negative outcomes for the socio-economic development of the region and desertification of large area. The change in water supply conditions of the territory around of Aral Sea Region and the drying of the Aral Sea related to it has caused the problem of desertification. Desertification means degradation process taking place in environment accompanied by a drop in the biologic productivity, development of erosion, salinization and other negative outcomes which directly influence the living conditions of the population and functioning of the region’s economy... 
 
Since early 1990s the growth rate of population started decreasing. While during 1991 to 1995, the yearly average growth rate of population amounted to 2.4%, including in towns: 2.5%, in rural areas: 2.2%, in the last four years it decreased and amounted to 1.5%, 1.5%, 1.6% respectively.]]></description>

Until now the gap before the first Wandjina rock art appeared was unexplained.

“Our research shows that the likely reason for the demise of the Gwion artists was a mega-drought spanning approximately 1500 years, brought on by changing climate conditions that caused the collapse of the Australian summer monsoon,” Associate Professor McGowan said.

He said a number of factors appear to have amplified the effects of the drought, such as a change in land surface condition and an increase in dust particles in the atmosphere, which caused a weakening or failure of monsoon rains.]]></description>

Evidence from Bangladesh suggests that rural–urban migration can be a coping strategy for households affected by environmental events. A survey from the island of Hatia, coastal Bangladesh, found that 22% of households used migration to cities as a coping strategy following tidal surges, and 16% following riverbank erosions. 
 
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh#Climate)
In September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and Meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, 9,700 km (6,000 mi) of road and 2,700 km (1,700 mi) of embankment, 1,000 people were killed and 30 million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, 50 km2 (19 sq mi) of land destroyed and 11,000 km (6,800 mi) of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater. There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high monsoon rains. Secondly, the Himalayas shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.]]></description>

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia)

Although there is lingering debate, pollen studies suggest that the climate of the BLB between about 29,500 and 13,300 cal BP was an arid, cool climate, with grass-herb-willow tundra. There is also some evidence that near the end of the LGM (~21,000-18,000 cal BP), conditions in Beringia deteriorated sharply. At about 13,300 cal BP, when rising sea levels began to flood the bridge, the climate appears to have been wetter, with deeper winter snows and cool summers.

Sometime between 18,000 and 15,000 cal BP, the bottleneck to the east was broken, which allowed human entrance into the North American continent along the Pacific coast. The Bering Land Bridge was completely inundated by rising sea levels by 10,000 or 11,000 cal BP, and its current level was reached about 7,000 years ago.]]></description>

Finally, China is now in its fourth decade of ever-growing internal migration, some of it driven in recent years by environmental change. Today, across its vast territory, China continues to experience the full spectrum of climate change-related consequences that have the potential to continue to encourage such migration. The Center for a New American Security recently found that the consequences of climate change and continued internal migration in China include “water stress; increased droughts, flooding, or other severe events; increased coastal erosion and saltwater inundation; glacial melt in the Himalayas that could affect hundreds of millions; and shifting agricultural zones”—all of which will affect food supplies.]]></description>

Migration is already a response in Mexico to changing environmental conditions, the 1980s agricultural crisis and economic liberalization. When Hurricane Stan passed through Chiapas, many people were surprised by the violence of its impact. One interviewee noted, "The river took away our homes and properties; we also were close to being taken away." Yet when very low-income villagers were asked whether migration was an option for them, most respondents underlined that they have no other lace to go. Yet, for those who are better off or who have relatives abroad, migration is an option.]]></description>

Migration Patterns and Mover Characteristics from the 2005 ACS Gulf Coast Area Special Products (http://www.census.gov/newsroom/emergencies/additional/gulf_migration.html)

Hurricane Katrina devastated the New Orleans and Mississippi Gulf Coast areas when it struck land on August 29, 2005. Almost four weeks later, on September 24, Hurricane Rita made landfall near the Louisiana-Texas border. The widespread damage caused by Katrina, and to a lesser extent Rita, uprooted thousands of people and changed the demographic, social, and economic face of the areas in the paths of the storms as well as those areas that saw great influxes of people escaping the destruction.

In order to measure the effects the hurricanes had on the population and housing in the area, the U.S. Census Bureau released the 2005 American Community Survey (ACS) Gulf Coast Area Special Products in June 2006. Two sets of estimates were produced to provide a picture of the population and housing units for Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas for the 8 months before and 4 months after Katrina and Rita. The migration estimates produced at that time were for where people currently lived and did not contain information on the specific location of their previous residences.]]></description>

"Out of Africa" --Which Way Did Humans Migrate?  

But the team from Bristol University has suggested that wetter conditions existed much further north than previously believed. As a result, a wet corridor through Libya might have existed, allowing for early human migrations to avoid what we know as today’s Sahara.

"Space-born radar images showed fossil river channels crossing the Sahara in Libya, flowing north from the central Saharan watershed all the way to the Mediterranean,” said Anne Osborne, lead author on the study. “Using geochemical analyses, we demonstrate that these channels were active during the last interglacial period. This provides an important water course across this otherwise arid region."]]></description>

Migration, particularly circular mobility, is a traditional coping mechanism in the region, representing a livelihood diversification strategy. But in some areas these traditional patterns have changed in recent decades. Each location has its specific characteristics, but migration and pressures on water and land systems are common denominators.A significant proportion of environmental migrants are displaced due to land degradation and drought in the Sahel, though drought-induced migration is often only temporary. Generally, there is a large migration movement to the coastal and urban agglomerations, and to the coastal states.]]></description>

Greening of Sahara Desert Triggered Early Human Migrations out of Africa                                                            
During three discrete periods, ca. 120,000-110,000 years, 50,000- 45,000 and 10,000-8,000 years ago, substantially more trees grew in Sahara and the Sahel, indicating significantly wetter conditions than at present. The two oldest periods exactly coincide with times when the earliest humans were migrating out of East Africa to northern Africa, the Middle East, Asia and eventually Europe. At these times, the wetter conditions in central North Africa likely enabled humans to cross this normally inhospitable region, allowing them to migrate into other continents. When climate in the Sahara and Sahel turned dry again, humans were forced out of these areas causing genetic and cultural changes in already inhabited regions such as Northern Africa and the Middle East.]]></description>

A cross-country analysis of determinants of urbanisation in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that deteriorating rainfall conditions do increase rural–urban migration. In contrast, however, evidence from Mali during the 1983-85 droughts shows that people who have been affected by drought are less able to afford to migrate to cities.]]></description>

MIGRATION AS AN ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE by R.McLeman and B. Smit

Page 32 -- During the 1930s, a period of particularly unfavourable climate for agriculture coincided with severe economic recession and rapid mechanization of farming. That decade witnessed a migration of approximately 300,000 people out of the US southwest and thousands more displaced within the region (Gregory, 1989).]]></description>

Climate change-induced migration and violent conﬂict  
 
Scholars predict that climate change will degrade the environment considerably during this century, ceteris paribus(IPCC, 2007a, 2007b). What are the implications of this prediction for human migration and violent conﬂict, deﬁned as a range of activities, in appropriation, insurgency, skirmishes, and interstate or intrastate wars? Gleditsch, Norda˚s, and Salehyan (2007) observe that climate change-induced migration appears in many climate change-to-violence scenarios
 
In Rwanda, for example, scholars argue Hutus came to resent Tutsis because the pro-Tutsi Belgian colonial policies made the Tutsis richer than the Hutus, making Rwanda more susceptible to conﬂict. However, scholars acknowledge that had it not been for the environmental problems, Rwanda would have been more resilient to this tension (e.g., Kane, 1995a, 1995b).]]></description>

How Nigeria’s vortex of violence is being driven by climate change and desertification (http://www.rtcc.org/2012/07/27/how-nigerias-vortex-of-violence-is-being-driven-by-climate-change-and-desertification/)

Last week a ten year old boy was killed after a rocket was fired at a school in the Nigerian city of Jos.                                                                                                
Over one hundred more people have been killed in the past two weeks amid the ongoing ethno-religious violence in across Plateau State, of which Jos is the capital.

Responses and accusations have abounded over the political and cultural reasons for the violence but little attention is being paid to one of the chief catalysts behind the conflict: climate change.
Climate change is a driver of conflict. Scarcity of resources, be they farmable land, water or livestock, is creating mass migrations and antagonising pre-existing tensions in a vicious circle.]]></description>

In 1000-1200 AD there is also an apparent downturn in precipitation. It may be recalled that during this period the Mongol invasions began, which resulted in the conquest of most of the known world at the time from China to Germany. During this period, the Asian steppes from which the Mongols originated were particularly dry (Huntington 1913). That the invasions began to cease in 1200 seems to be another coincidence in dates that is too strong to ignore, as the degradation in precipitation levels begins to settle around the same period.]]></description>

Kenyans draw weapons over shrinking resources (http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/27/world/la-fg-climate-conflict27-2009nov27)

Tribes that lived side by side for decades say they've been pushed to warfare by competition for disappearing water and pasture. The government is accused of exacerbating tensions by taking sides and arming combatants who once used spears and arrows.

The aim, all sides say, is no longer just to steal land or cattle, but to drive the enemy away forever.

It's a combustible mix of forces that the United Nations estimates has resulted in at least 400 deaths in northern Kenya this year. Moreover, experts worry that it's just the beginning of a new era of climate-driven conflict in Africa.

"There is a lesson in Darfur," said Richard Odingo, vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global scientific body that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. "Every dry area has the potential to be a flash point if we are not careful."]]></description>

Syria, Water, Climate Change, and Violent Conflict (http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/06/10/syria-water-climate-change-and-violent-conflict/)

One especially disturbing example of a major conflict, with complicated but direct connections to water, has developed over the past two years: the unraveling of Syria and the escalation of massive civil war there. Syria’s political dissolution is, like almost all conflicts, the result of complex and inter-related factors, in this case an especially repressive and unresponsive political regime, the erosion of the economic health of the country, and a wave of political reform sweeping over the entire Middle East and North Africa region. But in a detailed assessment, Femia and Werrell noted that factors related to drought, agricultural failure, water shortages, and water mismanagement have also played an important role in nurturing Syria’s “seeds of social unrest” and contributing to violence.]]></description>
