A number of hypotheses exist as to the origin and purpose of the structures. One viewpoint is a mixture of land-use practices of local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries and construction of structures by owner William Goodwin in the 1930s.[1] Other claims that the site has pre-Columbian origins are usually regarded as controversial, possibly pseudoarchaeological or the result of an early-20th century hoax.[2] Among structures at the site are standing stones that may have been erected to align with astronomical events.

Beginning after 1000 CE, people of the widespread Mississippian culture built a town at this site, covering 100 acres (0.40 km2) and situated on a large, terraced mound near the river. Today, Angel Mounds State Historic Site is nationally recognized as one of the best-preserved prehistoric Native American sites in the United States. It was given National Historic Landmark status as part of this recognition. This site is the most northeastern of the Mississippian culture, which had sites throughout the river valleys of the Mississippi and its tributaries, such as the Ohio River.

The site is believed to have been along the southern fringe of the hypothesized Bering land bridge, by which (according to that theory) the Americas were first settled. At the time of its settlement, sea level was believed to be lower (by about 100 metres (330 ft)), and the area consisted of a strandflat formation surrounded by nutrient-rich waters and abundant wildlife. The immediate area of the settlement is also surrounded by evidence of volcanic ashfalls, which are theorized to contribute to the eventual abandomnent of the site, leading to the settlement of other parts of Beringia.[4]

The construction of the Anna Site began c. 1200, corresponding to the beginning of the interaction among various Lower and Middle Mississippi cultures, leading to the formation of the Plaquemine culture.[2] There were minor occupations at the site but the most significant period of occupation at the site starts during the Gordon Phase 1000–1200 of the Coles Creek period (700-1200). Mound construction may have begun during this period but had definitely begun by the succeeding Anna Phase (1200 to 1350) and continued through the Foster Phase (1350-1500) and Emerald Phase (1500 to 1680). This 300-year period saw the transformation of the site into a regionally significant multi-mound center, possibly ruled over by a burgeoning hereditary elite class.[4] The site was occupied until c. 1500.[2]

The Anasazi inhabited Mesa Verde between 600 to 1300, though there is evidence they left before the start of the 15th century. They were mainly subsistence farmers, growing crops on nearby mesas. Their primary crop was corn, the major part of their diet. Men were also hunters, which further increased their food supply. The women of the Anasazi are famous for their elegant basket weaving. Anasazi pottery is as famous as their baskets; their artifacts are highly prized. The Anasazi kept no written records.
 
By the year 750 the people were building mesa-top villages made of adobe. In the late 1190s they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous.

The Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves ancestral Pueblo structures in north-western New Mexico, United States, located close to the town of Aztec and northeast of Farmington, near the Animas River. Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of Bloomfield near the San Juan River. The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the Azteccivilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the Anasazi.

Human presence in the area has been dated to over 10,000 years before present. Permanent settlements by ancestors of the Puebloan peoples have been dated to 1150 CE; these settlers had moved closer to the Rio Grande by 1550.[8] The distribution of basalt and obsidian artifacts from the area, along with other traded goods, rock markings, and construction techniques, indicate that its inhabitants were part of a regional trade network that included what is now Mexico.[9] Spanish colonial settlers arrived in the 18th century. The Pueblo Jose Montoya brought Adolph Bandelier to visit the area in 1880. Looking over the cliff dwellings, Bandelier said, "It is the grandest thing I ever saw."[10]

Prayers are offered here for healing, and atonement is made for harm done to others and to Mother Earth.[3]

Blackwater Draw contains an important archaeological site that was first recognized in 1929 by Ridgely Whiteman of Clovis, New Mexico. Blackwater Locality No. 1 is the type-site of the Clovis culture.[6] The first large-scale excavation came in 1932. Evidence of "fluted" points, spearheads also known as Clovis points (a New World invention) and other stone and bone weapons, tools, and processing implements were found at the archaeological site. The Clovis points were lanceolate and often longer than Folsom points. These artifacts are in association with the remains of extinct Late Pleistocene megafauna, including Columbian mammoth, camel, horse, bison, sabertooth cat, sloths, and dire wolf [7]that were hunted by the early peoples who visited the site. Generations of some of the earliest New World inhabitants lived at Blackwater Draw which created a layer of human settlement debris from those like Clovis, Folsom, Portales, and Archaic period occupants. The furthest back would be the Clovis culture with radiocarbon dating between 11,600-11,000 years before the present.[8] Blackwater Draw is among the first places these points were found and provides some of the best dated examples.]]></description>

The yard built the first U.S. ship of the line, USS Independence, but was primarily a repair and storage facility until the 1890s, when it started to build steel ships for the "New Navy". By then, it was called the Boston Navy Yard.

It is three miles west of Flagler Beach on CR 2001, south of SR 100, and contains the ruins of an ante-bellum plantation. The original plantation was begun in 1821, growing indigo, cotton, rice, and sugar cane. The property was acquired by the State of Florida in 1945 and dedicated as a State Historic Park in 1957. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 September 1970.[2]

Although there is some evidence of Late Archaic period (approximately 1200 BCE) occupation in and around the site,[6] Cahokia as it is now defined was settled around 600 CE during the Late Woodland period. Mound building at this location began with the Emergent Mississippian cultural period, about the 9th century CE.[7] The inhabitants left no written records beyond symbols on pottery, shell, copper, wood and stone, but the elaborately planned community, woodhenge, mounds and burials reveal a complex and sophisticated society.[8] The city's original name is unknown.

The national monument consists of the ruins of multiple structures surrounded by a compound wall constructed by the ancient people of the Hohokamperiod, who farmed the Gila Valley in the early 13th century. "Archeologists have discovered evidence that the ancient Sonoran Desert people who built the Casa Grande also developed wide-scale irrigation farming and extensive trade connections which lasted over a thousand years until about 1450 C.E."[5]

The name Casa Malpaís has been misinterpreted to mean House of the Badlands, but the name actually refers to the type of volcanic vesicular basalt rock, or Malapi, which the site is built upon.

Casa Rinconada is an isolated great kiva located on top of a ridge on the southern side of the canyon directly across from Pueblo Bonito.  It is located within a cluster of small house sites.  Two of the closest are Bc 58, 290 feet (85 m.) to the northeast, and Bc 50, 290 feet (85 m.) to the east.  Although the great kiva is not associated with a great house, there a group of masonry rooms attached to the perimeter, including a one-room antechamber to the south and an antechamber and three to six connected rooms to the north.  A few additional rooms also are attached on the east and west – possibly indicating a series of rooms that originally encircled the kiva (similar to the Great Kiva at Aztec West) . Vivian and Reiter (1960) suggest a PIII (1140-1200 A.D. – see Windes revised Chaco chronology) occupation for Casa Rinconada.]]></description>

In the early 19th century, the Coeur d'Alene Indians had heard of these powerful "medicine men" in black robes with a book and wanted some of these men for their own tribe. They sent men east to St. Louis, and in 1842 Father Pierre-Jean De Smet responded to the request and came to the area. Fr. Nicholas Point and Br. Charles Duet came and helped to pick a mission location. The first was along the St. Joe River, but was subject to flooding. In 1846 they moved it to the current location.

In 1850 the church was taken over by Antonio Ravalli, who began designing the new mission building. He made sure that the building was constructed by the Indians themselves, so that they could feel part of the church. It was built using the wattle and daub method, and was finished some three years later, without using a single nail.

Chetro Ketl is a Chacoan Ancestral Pueblo Great House and notable archaeological site located in Chaco Canyon in the U.S. state of New Mexico. In the cliffs behind the ruins there are ancient stairways that lead to prehistoric roadways that connect to Pueblo Bonito [1] located .5 km to the west. Chetro Ketl consists of a large set of rooms in a rectangular configuration similar to late era Great Houses at Chaco such as Kin Kletso, and a long D-shaped wall which encloses a packed earth plaza. The site has many architectural elements that appear to reflect Mexican Toltec influence. Begun c. AD 1020, its 450–550 rooms shared a great kiva which is among the largest ever built in the American Southwest. Scientists estimate that it took 29,135 man-hours of construction to erect Chetro Ketl; Hewett estimated that it required the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.[2]

It is located on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. Other contemporaneous groups in the area include the Parkin Phase, Menard Phase, and the Nodena Phase. It is known for the well preserved architectural, floral, faunal, and human osteological remains excavated there. During the early 1540s theHernando de Soto Expedition passed through the area, stopping at many villages along the way.

Although it is named for Vasquez de Coronado, who camped in the vicinity in 1540–1542, this archeological site is most noted for the ruins of Kuaua pueblo. The pueblo or village was settled about 1325 and abandoned toward the end of the 16th century because of pressure from both the Navajos and the Spanish. Kuaua was one of several Tiwa-speaking pueblos in the area when the conquistador Vasquez de Coronado arrived, and the village was almost certainly abandoned due to the after effects of the Tiguex War (February 1541).

Later investigators found that the bones and artifacts were mixed by redeposited stream sediments, confusing the early interpretations. Fossil bones of mammoth, horse, bison, antelope, coyote and dire wolf were found associated with the artifacts, which included fire-cracked rock, projectile points, and small grinding stones.

The presence of grinding stones has been interpreted to mean that people were beginning to adapt to the changes brought by the end of the Ice Age and theextinction of many of the large mammals. The coming of the Holocene Era (10,000 years Before Present) brought warmer and drier conditions to the Southwest. As a result, by 11,000-10,500 BP the Clovis culture was beginning to give way to more regional variants, which are generally called the Archaic cultures.[4]]]></description>

Dungeness on Cumberland Island, Georgia, is a ruined mansion that is part of a historic district that was the home of several families significant in American history. James Oglethorpe first built on Cumberland Island in 1736, building a hunting lodge that he named Dungeness. The next Dungeness was designed by Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, who had acquired 11,000 acres (45 km2) of island land in exchange for a bad debt. His widow built a four-story tabbymansion in 1803 on a Timucuan shell mound. During the War of 1812 the island was occupied by the British, who used the house as a headquarters. In 1818 Henry Lee III, known as Lighthorse Harry Lee and father of Robert E. Lee, stayed at the house until his death, and was buried there for a time. This house was abandoned during the U.S. Civil War and burned in 1866.[2]

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cuartelejo)

There are two possibilities for the origin of El Quartelejo. In 1664 a group of Pueblo Indians left New Mexico and were later rounded up and brought back by the Spanish. They may have constructed El Quartelejo, but more likely is the second possibility. After the collapse of the Pueblo Revolt (1680–1692) most Pueblo Indians accepted the return of Spanish dominion over their lives. A group from the Taos and Picuris Pueblos, however, did not. In 1696 this group fled New Mexico in search of a new home among the Plains Apache. They moved to the Great Plains and evaded the Spanish for ten years. During the years that followed came reports of Frenchmen attempting to trade with the Cuartelejo Apaches. The ill-fated Villazur expedition stopped at El Cuartelejo on its way north to investigate the extent of French influence. Near the forks of the Platte River, the Pawnees killed most of the party, reportedly under French direction. In 1706 they were captured and forced back to New Mexico. When the Pueblo Indians were seized, the Spanish commander, Juan Uribarri, wrote that they were dwelling in houses of a permanent type. The Spanish called this settlement El Quartelejo and the region around it was called San Luis Province.

The Presidio of San Francisco (originally, El Presidio Real de San Francisco or The Royal Fortress of Saint Francis) is a park and former military base on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Francisco, California, and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
It had been a fortified location since September 17, 1776, when New Spain established it to gain a foothold on Alta California and the San Francisco Bay. It passed to Mexico, which in turn passed it to the United States in 1848.[6] As part of a 1989 military reduction program under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, Congress voted to end the Presidio's status as an active military installation of the U.S. Army. On October 1, 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service, ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed commercial and public use.[7]]]></description>

The Emerald Mound Site (22 AD 504), also known as the Sellerstown site,[3] is a Plaquemine culture Mississippian period archaeological site located on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Stanton, Mississippi, United States. The site dates from the period between 1200 and 1730 CE. It is the type site for the Emerald Phase (1500 to 1680 CE) of the Natchez Bluffs Plaquemine culture chronology[4] and was still in use by the later historic Natchez people for their main ceremonial center. The platform mound is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the country, after Monk's Mound at Cahokia, Illinois.[1]

First proposed in 1807, it was under construction from 1817 to 1825 when it officially opened[2] on October 26, 1825. In a time when bulk goods were limited topack animals (an eighth-ton [250 pounds (113 kg)] maximum[3]), and there were no steamships or railways, water was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods or significant tonnages of any kind going back to the earliest days of recorded history.
The canal was the first transportation system between the eastern seaboard (New York City) and the western interior (Great Lakes) of the United States that did not require portage. It was faster than carts pulled by draft animals, and cut transport costs by about 95%.

The Farm Creek Section, also known as the Farmdale Geologic Exposure, is a hillside near East Peoria, Illinois that clearly showed geological strata. It is nationally significant as one of the first exposed glacial stratifications in the United States. These Ice Age geological formations, with rock layers representing different periods ofglaciation, had long been known and published in England, France, and Germany, but were not yet well known in the Western Hemisphere. Geologist Frank Leverettdiscovered this exposed face of a hill with its clearly defined stratifications in 1879 and described and pictured it in his monograph, The Illinois Glacial Lobe, in 1899.

Fort Boonesborough was a frontier fort in Kentucky, founded by Daniel Boone and his men following their crossing of the Kentucky River on April 1, 1775. The settlement they founded, known as Boonesborough, Kentucky, is Kentucky's second oldest European-American settlement. The first form of representative government in Kentucky was held here in May of 1775. By that summer, Boonesborough consisted of 26 one-story log cabins and four blockhouses.[1]
 
The fort was the scene of much action during the western theater of the American Revolutionary War. In September 1778, the fort withstood an attack by American Indians in what would later be called "The Great Siege." The settlement was later moved to Henderson, Kentucky.

Fort Bowie was established by the California Volunteers in 1862 after a series of engagements between the California Column and the Chiricahua Apaches. The most violent of which was the Battle of Apache Pass in July 1862. The fort was named in honor of Colonel George Washington Bowie commander of the5th California Infantry who first established the fort. The first Fort Bowie resembled more of a temporary camp than a permanent army post. In 1868, a second, more substantial Fort Bowie was built which included adobe barracks, houses, corrals, a trading post, and a hospital. The second Fort Bowie was built on a plateau about 300 yards (270 m) to the southeast of the first site. For more than 30 years Fort Bowie and Apache Pass were the focal point of military operations eventually culminating in the surrender of Geronimo in 1886 and the banishment of the Chiricahuas to Florida and Alabama. The fort was abandoned in 1894.

In 1853 the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment began construction of a new fort on a bluff five miles away from Fort Conrad. The new fort, named in honor of Captain Louis S. Craig, a popular young officer of theMexican-American War, was garrisoned in 1854 with troops from Fort Conrad.
Life at remote Fort Craig was uncomfortable and lonely at best and deadly at worst. The buildings were a constant source of misery to the soldiers and records reveal litanies of complaints about leaky roofs, crumbling walls and chimneys, crowded conditions and filth from crumbling dirt roofs and muddy floors.

In 1834 the Hudson Bay Company (HBC) tried to establish a post on the Stikine River, British rights to which had been one of the terms of the Russo-British Treaty of 1825. The effort was blocked, temporarily, by the Russians, resulting in high-level negotiations between the British and Russian governments. One result of these negotiations was the 1839 ten-year lease of what is today the Alaska Panhandle. Under the terms of the agreement the HBC had the right to establish posts, hunt, and trade furs along the coast in exchange for furnishing the Russian American Company with food. The HBC took advantage immediately, sending James Douglas north in the Beaverin 1840. Douglas explored the Taku River and built Fort Durham (or Taku) on the coast just south of the river's mouth. He also took possession of Redoubt San Dionisio (Fort Saint Dionysius), which lay off the mouth of the Stikine River on Etolin Island, near today's Wrangell, Alaska (and renamed it Fort Stikine), which the Russians had agreed to transfer to the HBC under the 1839 lease agreement.[4]

In 1841 the HBC governor George Simpson ordered Fort Durham and other coastal posts closed, because the Beaver was able to conduct the coastal fur trade without the need for more than the single permanent post of Fort Simpson. The HBC closed operations at Fort Durham in 1843.[5]

The Fort Durham Site was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1978.[2]]]></description>

Soon after Fort Hall, the Oregon and California trails diverged in northwesterly and southwesterly directions. An estimated 270,000 emigrants reached Fort Hall on their way west. The town of Fort Hall, Idaho later developed 11 miles to the east, and Pocatello developed about 30 miles south on the Snake River.]]></description>

The Confederate-controlled fort was besieged for 12 days by the fleet of U.S. Navy Flag OfficerDavid Farragut. Fort Jackson fell on April 28 after the Union fleet bombarded it and then sailed past its guns. A mutiny against the officers and conditions then occurred and the fort fell to the Union. Union forces then went on to capture New Orleans.[4]

The Braddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela at present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania. The French garrison defeated an attacking British regiment in September 1758 at the Battle of Fort Duquesne. French Colonel de Lignery ordered Fort Duquesne be destroyed and abandoned at the approach of General John Forbes's expedition in late November.[2]

The fort stood, until 1681, then was burned and looted by pirates. In 1719, Spanish Captain Jose Primo de Ribera arrived to construct a second wooden fort. The fort was called San Marcos de Apalache. The wood for construction was cut at Mission San Luis de Apalachee to the north.

As a stone fort, its construction began in 1739.]]></description>

The cliff contains the ruins of interlinked cave dwellings built in five cliff alcoves by the Mogollon peoples. People of the Mogollon culture lived in these cliff dwellings from between 1275 and 1300 AD (Pueblo III Era), which is the only location that contains Mogollon sites.[5] Archeologists have identified 46 rooms in the five caves, and believed they were occupied by 10 to 15 families. It is not known why the dwellings were abandoned. Hopi oral tradition does say migrations occurred due to cycles of beliefs, and in response to changing climate.

Once, thriving Native American trade communities of Tiwa and Tompiro language-speaking Puebloans inhabited this remote frontier area of central New Mexico. Early in the 17th century Spanish Franciscans found the area ripe for their missionary efforts. However, by the late 1670s the entire Salinas District, as the Spanish had named it, was depopulated of both Indian and Spaniard. What remains today are austere yet beautiful reminders of this earliest contact between Pueblo Indians and Spanish Colonials: the ruins of three mission churches, at Quarai, Abó, and Gran Quivira and the partially excavated pueblo of Las Humanas or, as it is known today, the Gran Quivira pueblo.

Grand Village of the Natchez, (22 AD 501) also known as the Fatherland Site, is a 128.1-acre (0.518 km2) site encompassing a prehistoric indigenous village andearthwork mounds in present-day south Natchez, Mississippi. The village complex was constructed starting about 1200 CE by members of the prehistoricPlaquemine culture. They built the three platform mounds in stages. Another phase of significant construction work by these prehistoric people has been dated to the mid-15th century. It was named for the historic Natchez people, who used the site in the 17th and 18th centuries.[4]

At 62 feet (19 m) high and 240 feet (73 m) in diameter, the Grave Creek Mound in the Ohio River Valley in West Virginia is one of the largest conical-type burial mounds in the United States. The builders of the site, members of the Adena culture, moved more than 60,000 tons of dirt to create it about 250-150 BC. Estimated to be 2,000 years old, the earthwork mound is located in present-day Moundsville near the banks of the Ohio River.

A non-degree student and employee of the University of California Llewellyn Lemont Loud (1879-1946)[5] conducted archaeological excavations of the island in 1918 that showed evidence of habitation since around 900 AD. The group of artifacts he excavated and described became known as the Gunther Pattern or Gunther Phase[4] which encompasses the final phase of native dominance lasting until historic times and describes a style of Native American projectile points,grave goods and other archaeological remains which identify a second migration within California around 300 AD.[6] The first major evidence of this came from Gunther Island Site 67 on Indian Island.[4]

Honokōhau means "bay drawing dew" and refers to the ancient settlement on the south part of the park. This area can be reached via trails from the park visitor's center, or from the small boat harbor access road on Kealakehe Parkway.[10] Features include loko iʻa (Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture fishponds), kahua (house site platforms), kiʻi pōhaku (petroglyphs), hōlua (stone slides) and heiau (religious sites). The ʻAiʻopio Fishtrap is a 1.7-acre (0.69 ha) pond, with a stone wall forming an artificial enclosure along the naturally curved shoreline of a bay. Small openings allowed young fish to enter from the sea, but as they grew larger (or at low tide) they were easily caught with nets inside the trap as needed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 as site 66000287.

The Ipiutak Site is a large archaeological site at Point Hope in northwest Alaska.

It is the type site for the Ipiutak culture, which arose possibly as early as 100–200 BCE and collapsed around 800 CE. The Ipiutak culture occurred from south of theBering Strait, across the Brooks Range and possibly as far north as Point Barrow.
The Ipiutak site was discovered in 1939 by archaeologists Helge Larsen and Froelich Rainey, who completed a monograph on the site in 1948. The site consists of nearly 600 abandoned house depressions along four beach ridges that impart a linearity that was originally interpreted as purposeful design as roads or “avenues.”

The site is significant for being the location of the Meskwaki-operated lead mine district overseen by Julien Dubuque ca. 1788–1810. The area was known as the "Mines of Spain" because Dubuque was required to submit his claims to Spain, who controlled the territory prior to 1801. After his death, the Meskwaki built a log crypt for Dubuque; which was replaced in the late 19th century by an imposing stone monument.

Ka Lae is the site of one of the earliest Hawaiian settlements, and it has one of the longest archaeological records on the islands.[2] It is generally thought that this is where the Polynesians first landed because the Big Island is the closest of the Hawaiian Islands to Tahiti, and Ka Lae would be the point of first landfall.[7] Ruins of an ancient Hawaiian temple (heiau) and a fishing shrine can be found here. In addition, ancient Hawaiians drilled numerous holes in the rock ledges to use for mooring their canoes. Tying long ropes to their boats, they would drift out to sea to fish without fear of being carried away by the strong currents.[8] Anthropologists from the Bishop Museum excavated the area in the 1960s.[9][10][11]

The impact of both the broken connections with the ʻaina and of family members "lost" to Kalaupapa are still felt in Hawaiʻi today.

Kamehameha I (also known as Kamehameha the Great), who unified the Hawaiian Islands, lived out the last years of his life and instituted some of the most constructive measures of his reign (1810–1819) here. The residential compound included the personal shrine, ʻAhuʻena heiau, of the King.[2] The name means "temple of the burning altar" in the Hawaiian Language.[3]

The property is now part of King Kamehameha's Kona Beach Hotel; none of the houses or walls remain. ʻAhuʻena heiau was reconstructed in the 1970s and can be viewed, but not entered. Some artifacts can be viewed in the hotel lobby, including a feather cloak and helmet (mahiole). The small sandy beach provides a protected beach for launching canoes, and children swimming. The first Hotel was built here in 1950, and the current one constructed in 1975. In 2009, the hotel was renovated, and a museum and cultural center added.

Kin Kletso (Navajo for “yellow house”), is a McElmo-style great house with approximately 65 rooms and 5 kivas. The kiva at the western end of the building has been identified as a tower kiva.  The ground plan is rectangular and, unlike many earlier great houses, there is no associated great kiva and no plaza.  The pueblo was three stories on the north side, dropping to two stories over the remainder of the building.   Kin Kletso is located roughly 0.5 miles (0.8 km.) northwest of Pueblo Bonito and is accessible at the beginning of the National Park Service Pueblo Alto trail.  Construction has been dated to A.D. 1125-1130 based on a strong cluster of tree-ring dates.]]></description>

The Kincaid Mounds Historic Site (11MX2-11; 11PO2-10)[3] circa 1050-1400 CE,[4] was among the largest prehistoricMississippian culture chiefdom centers, located at the southern tip of present day U.S. state of Illinois. Kincaid Mounds has been notable for both its significant role in native North American prehistory and for the central role the site has played in the development of modern archaeological techniques. The site had at least 11 substructure platform mounds (ranking 5th for mound-culture pyramids). Artifacts from the settlement link its major habitation and the construction of the mounds to the Mississippian period, but it was also occupied earlier during the Woodland period.

The Lowry Pueblo is an Ancestral Puebloan archaeological site located in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument near Pleasant View, Colorado, United States. The pueblo was constructed about 1060 AD atop abandoned pithouses from an earlier period of occupation. It was occupied by 40 to 100 people at a time over 165 year.[3] The inhabitants were farmers who also hunted small game, made elaborately decorated pottery, and wove cotton obtained by trade. The pueblo was named for early homesteader George Lowry. Its last occupation occurred in the early 13th century much of its architetctual influences have come from Chaco Canyon, which is 100 miles south of New Mexico.[3] The structure contains about 40 rooms and multiple kivas.

The site clearly shows many levels of cultural deposits that can be dated accurately due to the presence of clear geological stratigraphy (layers of various sediments representing different periods of time). From these deposits, nearly 175 radiocarbon dates are available. The Lubbock Lake Landmark exhibits a virtually complete cultural sequence from the Clovis Period to historic times. These periods are easily distinguished due to the separation of sediment layers containing cultural material by sterile layers where sediment lacks artifacts.

Each layer represents a different time period, water regime, group of plants and animals, group of peoples, and climate and environment covering the past 12,000 years of history and prehistory. The time of people in North America generally is divided into five cultural periods, all of which are represented at Lubbock Lake Landmark.]]></description>

The Marmes Rockshelter (also known as (45-FR-50)) is an archaeological site first excavated in 1962,[3] near the confluence of the Snake and Palouse Rivers, in Franklin County, southeastern Washington. This rockshelter is remarkable in the level of preservation of organic materials, the depth of stratified deposits, and the apparent age of the associated Native American human remains. The site was discovered on the property of Roland Marmes, and was the site of the oldest human remains in North America at that time.[4] In 1966, the site became, along with Chinook Point and the American and English Camps on San Juan Island, the first National Historic Landmarks listed in Washington.[5] In 1969, the site was submerged in water when a leveeprotecting it from waters rising behind the then newly constructed Lower Monumental Dam, which was 20 miles (32 km) down the Snake River, failed to hold back water that leaked into the protected area through gravel under the soil,[4] creating Lake Herbert G. West.

Located near the summit of Mauna Kea at an elevation above 12,000 feet (3,700 m) at 19°48′1″N 155°28′4″W along the Mauna Kea Trail, this is the largest primitive quarry in the world.[7] The archaeological complex also includes religious shrines, trails, rock shelters, and petroglyphs. The Hawaiian language name for the quarry was Keanakākoʻi.[8]

The Anasazi inhabited Mesa Verde between 600 to 1300, though there is evidence they left before the start of the 15th century. They were mainly subsistence farmers, growing crops on nearby mesas. Their primary crop was corn, the major part of their diet. Men were also hunters, which further increased their food supply. The women of the Anasazi are famous for their elegant basket weaving. Anasazi pottery is as famous as their baskets; their artifacts are highly prized. The Anasazi kept no written records.

Mission San Cayetano de Calabazas, also known as Calabasas, was founded by Jesuit missionary Father Francisco Xavier Pauer in 1756 when he relocated at least seventy-eight Pima Indians to the site from their village of Toacuquita in what is now Arizona, near Tumacácori. The church, houses and the granary were set ablaze during an Apache attack in 1777; the Mission was abandoned in 1786 due to continuing problems with the natives. Between 1807 and 1830 the settlement was used as an estancia (farm) for Mission San José de Tumacácori. In 1808, European settlers moved into Calabazas and restored the chapel. In response, the Apaches again attacked, setting fire to the buildings and carrying off sacred vessels and vestments in the process.

Mission San Luis de Apalachee (also known as San Luis de Talimali) was a Spanish Franciscan mission built in 1633 in theFlorida Panhandle, two miles west of the present-day Florida Capitol Building in Tallahassee, Florida. It was located in the descendent settlement of Anhaica (also as Anhayca Apalache or Inihayca) capital of Apalachee Province. The mission was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region, and convert the Timucuan and Apalachee Indians to Christianity. The mission lasted until 1704, when it was evacuated and destroyed to prevent its use by an approaching militia of Creek Indians and South Carolinians.

The site has over 28 feet of sediment that contain artifacts. Evidence from the site, including four separate periods of Archaic occupation and one of a later period, suggests that the cultures of the Eastern Woodlands may have been comparable in age to the big game hunting cultures of theGreat Plains. Based on the analysis of artifacts, archaeologists discovered that 9,000 years ago this rock shelter was used as a short-term camp by small hunting groups; by 6,000 years ago this rock shelter was used for long-term based camps by several families which were involved in activities of everyday life; and, by around 4,000 years ago evidence found in the sediment layers suggests the site was again used by small hunting parties as a short-term camp.[3] There tools included concave projectile points, scrapers, choppers, hammer stones, and bone awls. Evidence has shown that during occupation, the inhabitants had a diet that consisted of deer, raccoon, opossum, birds, and fish.

Evidence suggests the current temple was built on the site of a smaller older one, by Paʻao, who brought the Hawaiian Religion to the islands somewhere between 1100-1300 A.D.

The current site includes remains of the sacrificial temple measuring 250’ x 130’ with an open stone paved court enclosed by 20’-high stone walls, and the sacrificial stone.[3]

Betatakin means "House Built on a Ledge" in Navajo. In Hopi, the name of the place is Talastima, or "Place of the Corn Tassel".[6] Betatakin is smaller than nearby Kiet Siel, with about 120 rooms at the time of abandonment. However, like Kiet Seel, Betatakin was constructed of sandstone, mud mortar, and wood. Today only about 80 rooms remain, due to rock falls inside the alcove. Betatakin only has one kiva,[5] whereas Kiet Siel has several. Betatakin was built in an enormous alcove measuring 452 feet high and 370 feet across between 1267 and 1286[7] The first excavations occurred in 1917 under Neil Judd, and continued into the 1950s and 1960s under archaeologists like Jeffery Dean.[5] During its two-decade heyday Dean estimated a maximum population of about 125 people.

The Newark Earthworks in Newark and Heath, Ohio, consists of three sections of preserved earthworks: the Great Circle Earthworks, the Octagon Earthworks, and the Wright Earthworks. This complex contained the largest earthen enclosures in the world, being about 3,000 acres in extent. Today, the site itself covers 206 acres. The site is preserved as a state park by the Ohio Historical Society. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 2006, Newark Earthworks was also designated as the "official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio."[2]

Intact, NPS-GGNRA, Angel Island State Park. Three launch areas. This is an early Ajax-only site that was never converted to Hercules. The mountain between the launcher and the IFC was "notched" in three places to allow the Missile Tracking Radar to acquire the missile while sitting on the launcher. The three underground magazines are existent and in reasonable good condition. The area is off limits to visitors at Angel Island State Park.]]></description>

Ninety Six had become a prosperous village by the time the American Revolutionary Warcame knocking at the door. The first land battle of the war fought in South Carolina took place at Ninety Six in 1775. The village became a Loyalist stronghold early in the war and was fortified by the British in 1780. From May 22 - June 18, 1781, Continental Army Major GeneralNathanael Greene led 1,000 troops in a siege against the 550 Loyalists in the village. The 28-day siege, the longest of the entire war, centered on an earthen star fort. Despite having more troops, Greene's patriots were eventually unsuccessful in taking the town.

Obsidian Cliff, also known as 48YE433, was an important source of lithic materials for prehistoric peoples in Yellowstone National Park near Gardiner, Montana.

Obsidian from this site was first quarried here about 12,000 years ago. Early natives of North America placed a high value on the obsidian that came from this cliff as well as other similar obsidian deposits in the area because numerous tools could be fashioned from obsidian - most popularly knives, spear/arrow tips, and other sharp edged objects.

The prison was originally a copper mine, opened in 1705, and is believed to be the first copper mine in America. After mining operations proved unprofitable, the colony of Connecticut converted it to a prison, like its London namesake Newgate Prison. The first prisoner, John Hinson, was committed for burglary in 1773. Later Tories and Loyalists were held here during the American Revolutionary War.

The Old Sheldon Church Ruins is a historic site located in northern Beaufort County, South Carolina, approximately 17 miles (30 km) north of Beaufort in the Sheldon area.[2][3] Known also as the Sheldon Church or Old Sheldon Church, the pre-existing building was originally known as Prince William's Parish Church. The church was built in the Greek Revival style between 1745 and 1753. Prince William's was burned by the British in 1779 during the Revolutionary War. In 1826 it was rebuilt. Contrary to the onsite signs based on a letter written by a Yankee, it was not burnt in 1865 by William Tecumseh Sherman.

An alternative view has more recently come to light, however. In a letter dated February 3, 1866,[4] Miton Leverett wrote that "Sheldon Church not burn't. Just torn up in the inside, but can be repaired." The inside of the church was apparently gutted to reuse materials to rebuild homes burnt by Sherman's army.

The first Pecos pueblo was one of two dozen rock-and-mud villages built in the valley around AD 1100 in the prehistoric Pueblo II Era. Within 350 years the Pueblo IV Era Pecos village had grown to house more than 2,000 people in its five-storied complex.[4]

Pictograph Cave is a 23-acre (93,000 m2) area of three caves (Pictograph, Middle, and Ghost caves) located 5 miles (8 km) south of Billings, Montana, United States.

Excavation of the three caves began in 1937, and they were the site of some of Montana's first professional archeological studies.[3] Over 30,000 artifacts have been identified, with at least 20,000 animal remains recovered from the site. Species range from large mammalian species, including bison (Bos bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus), to various species of herpetiles (reptiles and amphibians) and avies (birds). The presence of these remains result from human predation, processing and consumption as well as non-human (carnivores and raptors) predation and individual species who lived and died in and around the site. The pictographs are more than 2,100 years old. However their interpretations are still debated over.

The complex, which includes 17 mounds, an earthen geometric enclosure, and numerous habitation areas, was most likely built during the Middle Woodland period (c. 1-500 A.D.). The complex is the largest group of Middle Woodland mounds in the United States. Sauls' Mound, at 72 feet, is the second-highest surviving mound in the United States.

Poverty Point comprises several earthworks and mounds built between 1650 and 700 BCE, during the Archaic period in the Americas by a group of Native Americans of the Poverty Point culture. The culture extended 100 miles (160 km) across the Mississippi Delta. The original purposes of Poverty Point have not been determined by archaeologists, although they have proposed various possibilities including that it was: a settlement, a trading center, and/or a ceremonial religious complex.

In 1643, Johan Printz moved his capital from Fort Christina (located in what is now Wilmington, Delaware) to Tinicum Island. At that time Fort Gothenburg was established in addition to Printz’s dwelling and headquarters. Two years later a fire swept over the newly established settlement. The Printzhof was reconstructed more solidly and lavishly. The two-story log structure contained lumber sent from Sweden, glass windows and lavish draperies.[3]
 
Today, the Printzhof’s stone foundations are the only remains of the settlement. The Printzhof site is located near the intersection of Taylor Avenue and Second Street in Essington, Pennsylvania. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.[2][5]

The prehistoric Hohokam culture, one of four Oasisamerica traditions of the Ancient Pueblo People, created the archaeological structures and items of Pueblo Grande. It is believed that this area was settled around 450 CE. Due to major population movements, among other factors, the site was abandoned by 1450 CE.

Pueblo Grande features a large platform mound with retaining walls, that was formerly surmounted by walled structures. This massive structure contains over 20,000 cubic meters (yards) of fill. There were also many dwellings, and at least three ball courts. Construction of the ball courts was begun by 750 CE.[4]

The highest of the three walled enclosures may date to the 17th century, with the lower two enclosures perhaps added during the 18th century. These were times of great conflict, and the upper platform appears to have functioned as a heiau luakini (sacrificial temple) to bring success in war.

Between AD 900 and 1580, up to 1500 pueblo Indians lived in the area where they hunted game and cultivated food. Native peoples first settled in the area in the late AD 900s of the Pueblo II Era, living in dispersed farmstead dwellings at the east side of the Jemez Mountains. Their settlements increased and changed over time in the Pueblo III Era, when they lived in larger, concentrated villages of Otowi, Puye, Shufinne, Tsankawi, Tsirege, and Tyuonyi.[3]  

The Puye Cliffs complex, the largest complex on the Pajarito Plateau, includes two levels of cliff-dwellings and surface and cave dwellings.

The Ramsey Mill was built by Alexander Ramsey and Dr. Thomas Foster in 1856-1857 on the Vermillion River in the town ofHastings in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The river had a head of 19 feet (6 m) and a width of 50 feet (15 m) near the 4 storygristmill. An addition included a cooper shop and storage facility. Although Ramsey sold his interest in 1877, it retained his name. Maximum output was achieved in 1894, at 125 barrels per day. On December 22, 1894, the building burned, possibly due toarson.[2][3]

San Bernardino Ranch is a site in the southern San Bernardino Valley in the region of the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge in extreme southeast Cochise County, Arizona that is significant for its association with the beginning of cattle ranching in southern Arizona and northern Mexico. The ranchland and valley are part of the headwater region of the Yaqui River.

In 1911, during the conflict known as the Border War, a United States Army camp was established at the ranch and was called Camp San Bernardino Ranch, or theSlaughter Ranch Outpost.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.[2][3][4]

The site is now known as the Slaughter Ranch, for it once was the home of a famous Old West gunfighter, "Texas" John Slaughter. The compound includes the ranch house, wash house, icehouse, granary and commissary. The museum is also known as the Johnson Historical Museum of the Southwest.

Squire's Castle is a shell of a building located in the North Chagrin Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks in Willoughby Hills, Ohio (visible from River Road). It was built in the 1890s by Feargus B. Squire for use as the gatekeeper's house for his future country estate, which was never built. Squire, a founder of Standard Oil Company, bought the surrounding 525 acres (212 ha) of land but never completed the project. Squire sold the property in 1922 and the Cleveland Metroparks acquired it in 1925.

Today Squire's Castle is open to the public free-of-admission. In 2008 the structure still had a roof, the interior was bare and open to the elements, and second story no longer had a floor. The Willoughby Hills Public Library annually holds a history seminar there. The surrounding park offers a footpath, riding trails, cooking grills, and a large grassy field.

Ventana Cave (O'odham: Nakaijegel) is an archaeological site in southern Arizona. It is located on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation. The cave was excavated by Emil Haury and Julian Hayden in 1941-42. The deepest artifacts from Ventana Cave were recovered from a layer of volcanic debris that also contained Pleistocene horse, Burden's pronghorn, tapir, sloth, and other extinct and modern species. A projectile point from the volcanic debris layer was compared to the Folsom Tradition and later to the Clovis culture, but the assemblage was peculiar enough to warrant a separate name – the Ventana Complex. Radiocarbon dates from the volcanic debris layer indicated an age of about 11,300 BP.[3]

The West Point Foundry was an early ironworks in Cold Spring, New York that operated from 1817 to 1911. Set up to remedy deficiencies in national armaments production after the War of 1812, it became most famous for its production of Parrott rifles and other munitions during the Civil War, although it also manufactured a variety of iron products for civilian use. The rise of steel making and declining demand for cast iron after the Civil War caused it to gradually sink into bankruptcy and cease operations in the early 20th Century.

The many settlement sites scattered throughout the monument were built by the Ancient Pueblo People, more specifically the Sinagua, Cohonina, and Kayenta Anasazi. Wupatki was first inhabited around 500 AD. Wupatki, which means "Tall House" in the Hopi language, is a multistory Sinagua pueblo dwelling having more than 100 rooms. Secondary structures, including two large, apparently uncovered kivalike structures, stand nearby.[5] A major population influx began soon after the eruption of Sunset Crater in the 11th century (between 1040 and 1100), which blanketed the area with volcanic ash; this improved agricultural productivity and the soil's ability to retain water.

The main building was built in 1828 by A. R. Wynne, William Cage, and Stephen Roberts, to serve as a stagecoach inn for travelers between Nashville and Knoxville. In 1834, Wynne purchased his partners' shares in the property and moved into the inn with his family, where he resided until his death in 1893.

A grouping of six log buildings, the main one and five dependencies, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[1] It was further declared aNational Historic Landmark, later in 1971.[2][3]

The main building is 110 feet long and 22 feet wide.[1]
