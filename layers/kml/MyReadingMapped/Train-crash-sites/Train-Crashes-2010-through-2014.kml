At 20:55 hrs on Sunday 6 June 2010 train 1Y27, the 18:20 hrs from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban, struck a boulder that had fallen onto the track just west of the station at Falls of Cruachan, in the Pass of Brander, on the line from Crianlarich to Oban. The boulder had fallen onto the track from its position on the slope within the railway boundary because of root jacking and soil erosion.
 
The evidence from the site of the accident was that the train, consisting of a 2-car class 156 diesel multiple unit, drove over the boulder, which lifted up the front car and derailed it to the left and down an embankment (figure 1). The leading bogie of the rear car ended up supported by the boulder with the rear bogie still on the track (figure 2).]]></description>

On Sunday, 20th June 2010, a Father’s Day Special Train operated by Friends of the Rail (FOTR) had an unfortunate accident near Cullinan. 
 
A large number of wooden sleepers were missing, apparently stolen, from under the railway line. Being on a sharp curve and spotted just at the last second, we were unable to stop in time and the inevitable result was the derailment pictured here. Luckily, none of the 600-odd passengers, including many young children, on board suffered any major injury. 
 
Not so lucky was the beautiful old steam locomotive, Class 15F number 3117. She will almost certainly require extensive and expensive repairs and a complete re-certification before she can run again.]]></description>

The four-carriage electric rolling stock set which had been stationed for the morning trip from Aegviidu station had started moving without the permission of the train traffic regulator.

The freight train crew followed all the rules and signals and had slowed down and planned to stop the train at the next signal. One fatality resulted from the collision.]]></description>

At least five passengers were killed Wednesday (Apr. 27) noon when a train overturned on the scenic Alishan Forest Railway in Chiayi County, according to the southern Taiwan county's Fire Department.

107 passengers aboard the train, including tourists from China, were injured, the department said.
The accident took place at the alpine railway's 70-kilometer mark located between the Sacred Tree Station and Alishan Station. Witnesses said a tree had fallen over the railway line which caused four of the train's carriages to overturn.

Some carriages were reported to fall under a three-meter high bridge. One of the carriages even rotated 180 degrees, causing passengers inside be piled up together.]]></description>

A fire started in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid on 16 June 2011. It was caused by sparks from welding, which had been completed at 07:45. A freight train passed through the station at 09:16 and the welders left the station at 09:30. The passenger trains which caught on fire, pass through the station at 10:06.[12] As the station is unmanned, there was no prior warning of the fire until the motorman saw it from the cab just as the train entered the tunnel. At nearly the same instance, he reached the point of the line were the fire had caused the power to cut. He immediately applied the emergency brake, which allowed the train to stop 5 to 10 meters (16 to 33 ft) from the fire. Because the train had no power, it was not possible to reverse out. The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated, which took 15 to 20 minutes, and included two people in a wheelchair. Passengers were told to not bring any possessions with them, and many passengers lost valuables, such as laptop computers. All personnel acted according to regulations and no-one was injured in the accident. According to the motorman, had he not lost the power, he would have continued through the tunnel, as the fire was just beginning.[13]]]></description>

Ten of the derailed cars contained ethanol, a hazardous material; ethanol released from the damaged tank cars ignited and burned. Property damage was estimated to be $1.6 million. The engineer and the conductor were not injured. No emergency responders were injured during the fire suppression and cleanup efforts.

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was a broken rail. Contributing to the large quantity of hazardous materials released was inadequate puncture resistance of the tank heads and shells of the DOT-111A-100W1 general service tank cars and the failure of draft sill attachments.]]></description>

It buried them where they sat, cascading past them to the street below, leaving just enough evidence of their presence to show in the spotlight from the officer below.]]></description>

At 15:24 (local time) on 26 October 2012, a push-pull passenger train running in push mode passed a signal at danger and struck the rear of another passenger train which was waiting between Bratislava Vinohrady and Bratislava Main stations. 
 
Two people (including one of the drivers) were seriously injured; a further 21 sustained slight injuries. 
 
The investigation found that the accident was caused by the driver of the push-pull train failing to observe the red signal and failing to brake in time to avoid the collision]]></description>

At 20:41 CEST (18:41 UTC) on 24 July 2013[1][7] the passenger train, on an express route from Madrid Chamartín railway station to Ferrol, derailed on a section of conventional track at the end of the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia line, at Angrois in Santiago de Compostela.[8] All vehicles, the two power cars, their adjacent generator cars – both with diesel tanks – at both ends of the train and the nine intermediate carriages, derailed as the train rounded the A Grandeira curve; four cars overturned.[8] A track-side CCTV camera video indicates that the front generator car was the first to leave the rails, followed by the leading passenger coaches, the front power car, the rear generator car and finally the rear power car.[9] The train was carrying 218 passengers at the time of the crash.[1] Three of the carriages were torn apart in the accident and another caught fire due to gaseous leaking diesel fuel. The rear generator car also caught fire. Unofficial technical reports disclose that the train was travelling at over twice the posted speed limit when it entered the curve.[10]]]></description>

A 90-car train carrying North Dakota crude derailed and exploded in a rural area of western Alabama early on Friday, leaving 11 cars burning and potentially bolstering the push for tougher regulation of a boom in moving oil by rail.

Twenty of the train's cars derailed and a number were still on fire on Friday afternoon, local officials said. Those cars, which threw flames 300 feet into the night sky, are being left to burn out, which could take up to 24 hours, according to the train owner, Genesee & Wyoming. No injuries were reported.

The accident happened in a wetlands area that eventually feeds into the Tombigbee River, according to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. Booms were placed in the wetlands to contain the spilled oil.]]></description>

SLINGER, Wis. (AP) — Two people were injured and more than a hundred homes were evacuated due to a diesel spill from a train derailment in Wisconsin, according to fire officials.

Slinger Fire Department Chief Rick Hanke said three engines and 10 railcars derailed Sunday night. He said trains from Canadian National Railway Co. and Wisconsin & Southern were involved. He said officials don't yet know what caused the derailment.

About 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel was spilled from an engine, he said. Hazmat crews had dikes and booms in place to contain the spill.]]></description>
