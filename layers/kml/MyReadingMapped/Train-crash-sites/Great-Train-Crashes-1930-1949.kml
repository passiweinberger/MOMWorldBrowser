"Although the signalman on duty was ultimately responsible for the collision, there were several contributing factors. The layout of the section was complex, with four running lines and a junction between the main Warrington-Preston line and the Warrington-Earlestown branch line. Both these two lines carried heavy rail traffic. There was so much traffic in fact, that the signalman had a booking lad with him in the signal box. The booking lad's function was to keep the train register and use it to remind the signalman of the position of trains within the section at any time."]]></description>

"The crash occurred on 15 June 1935. A train from London Kings Cross to Leeds collided with a train from Kings Cross to Newcastle at night and 14 people were killed and 29 injured.

The accident was a rear collision caused by a signalman's error. The signalman at Welwyn Garden City, who had been fairly recently appointed to the box, became confused and accepted two trains into the same block section. The first (Newcastle) train received a signal check and was slowed down to 15-20 mph; the Leeds train consisting of 11 coaches hauled by Class K3 2-6-0 No 4009 ran into it at approximately 65 mph."]]></description>

Earlier that same day, the same engine and crew had passed over the same location westbound, and at that time the trestle crossing was in good condition."]]></description>

"Everything appeared in order as the train passed through North Philadelphia station ahead of schedule and slowed its speed, but shortly afterward, as it passed a rail yard, workers noticed flames coming from a journal box (a hot box) on one of the cars and rang the next signal tower at Frankford Junction, but the call came too late. Before the tower man could react, disaster struck as the train passed his signal tower at 6:06 pm traveling at a speed of 56 mph. The journal box on the front of car #7 seized and an axle snapped, catching the underside of the truck and catapulting the car upwards. It struck a signal gantry, which peeled off its roof along the line of windows "like a can of sardines". Car #8 wrapped itself around the gantry upright in a figure U. The next six cars were scattered at odd angles over the tracks, and the last two cars remained undamaged, with bodies of the 79 dead lying scattered over the tracks."]]></description>

"Early that morning an unusually long and heavy freight train developed problems (unofficially a hot box) whilst travelling west from Ogden. This required the first section of the Pacific Limited which comprised 18 cars headed by SP GS-3 No.4425 to stop and then proceed with caution. The second section, comprising 20 cars headed by SP Mt-4 No.4361 apparently unaware of the problems ahead continued at full speed. At Bagley a siding, 17 miles west of Ogden at 5.14 a.m. in thick fog the mail express ploughed into the Pullman car at the back of the passenger train. The Ogden Standard Examiner reported "The force of the impact sent another sleeping car smashing through the dining car and farther ahead slammed one coach into the wooden coach ahead of it. Cars of the mail express section piled up crossways of the track behind the engine, some of them sliding down the causeway embankment into water."]]></description>

"the Jørstadelva Bridge sabotage, was an operation carried out on 13 January 1945 by members of the Norwegian Independent Company 1 during World War II. The operation bore the code-name "Woodlark". The aim was to blow up a railway bridge in order to disrupt the railway Nordland Line in Snåsa, Norway. Six hours after the bridge had been destroyed, a military troop train unaware of the sabotage derailed and crashed into the river below, killing 70-80 people (among them two Norwegians) and injuring some 100 more. It remains the single most deadly rail incident ever in Norway."]]></description>
