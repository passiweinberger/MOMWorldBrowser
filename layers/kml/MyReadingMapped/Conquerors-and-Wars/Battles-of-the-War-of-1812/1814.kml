The Burning of Washington in 1814 was an attack during the War of 1812 between British forces and those of the United States of America. On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross occupied Washington City and set fire to many public buildings, including the White House (known as the presidential mansion at the time), and the Capitol, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government.[3] The attack was in part a retaliation to American actions in the Raid on Port Dover.Throughout the history of the United States, the United Kingdom is the only country to have ever burned the White House or Washington, D.C., and this was the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power captured and occupied the United States capital.]]></description>

The Battle of Baltimore was a sea/land battle fought between British and American forces in the War of 1812. American forces repulsed sea and land invasions off the busy port city of Baltimore, Maryland, and killed the commander of the invading British forces. The British and Americans first met at North Point.[9] Though the Americans retreated, the battle was a successful delaying action that inflicted heavy casualties on the British, halted their advance and allowed the defenders at Baltimore to properly prepare for an attack. The resistance of Baltimore’s Fort McHenry during bombardment by the Royal Navy inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the poem "Defence of Fort McHenry" which later became the lyrics for "The Star-Spangled Banner," the national anthem of the United States of America.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_North_Point

The Battle of North Point was fought on September 12, 1814, (later celebrated as a state, city and county holiday as "Defenders' Day") between Brigadier General John Stricker's (1758–1825) Third Brigade ("Baltimore City Brigade" or "City Brigade") of the Maryland State Militia and a British landing force of units from the "King's Army", Royal Navy seamen, and Royal Marines led by Major General Robert Ross (1766–1814) and Rear Admiral George Cockburn (1772–1853). Although the Americans eventually retreated after standing up for several hours in a close rifle, musket and artillery duel, they were able to do so in good order having inflicted significant greater casualties on the British, with concealed American riflemen sharpshooters having killed General Ross, the commander of the invading force, significantly demoralizing the troops under his command and leaving some of his units lost among the "Patapsco Neck's" woods, marshes and swampy creeks, with others in confusion. This combination prompted British second-in-command, Colonel Arthur Brooke, of the 44th Regiment of Foot, (1772–1843), to have his troops remain on the battlefield for the evening and night treating the wounded at the nearby Methodist meeting house and delaying his advance against Baltimore. Having "bloodied" the invaders, giving them a "taste" of the reception awaiting them and buying valuable time to additionally properly prepare for the defense of the city under Major General Samuel Smith, (1752–1839) at the mile-long extensive dug-in trenches and fortifications with the central strong point of "Rodgers' Bastion" commanded by the U.S. Navy's famed Captain and Commodore John Rodgers (1772–1838, of the Susquehanna River port towns of Harford County's Havre de Grace and Cecil County's Perryville) flanked by several others along Loudenschlager's Hill (now "Hampstead Hill" in Patterson Park of East Baltimore's Highlandtown and Canton neighborhoods), Stricker slowly retreated back to the main defenses cutting down trees across the roads to delay the "Red Coats" advance, and to bolster the existing militia and civilian forces of approximately 15,000 with a hundred cannons. The engagement was a part of the larger Battle of Baltimore, an American victory in the several phases of the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812.]]></description>

An unsuccessful invasion of the United States along the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain by a British army reinforced by regulars transferred to North America following Napoleon's abdication. The American victory had a significant impact on the negotiations at Ghent to end the war, allowing the Americans to insist upon exclusive rights to Lake Champlain and to deny the British exclusive rights to the Great Lakes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plattsburgh

The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, it could not be supplied without control of the lake.

The battle took place shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war. This American victory, and the successful defense at the Battle of Baltimore which began the next day and halted British advances in the Mid-Atlantic states, denied the British negotiators at Ghent leverage to demand any territorial claims against the United States on the basis of Uti possidetis, i.e. retaining territory they held at the end of hostilities.[5]]]></description>

Fort Bowyer was a short-lived earthen and stockade fortification that the United States Army erected in 1813 on Mobile Point, near the mouth of Mobile Bay in Baldwin County, Alabama. The British twice attacked the fort during the War of 1812. The first, unsuccessful attack, took place in September 1814 and led to the British changing their strategy and attacking New Orleans. The second attack, following their defeat at the Battle of New Orleans, was successful. However, it took place in February 1815, after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed but before the news had reached that part of America.[1] Between 1819 and 1834 the United States built a new masonry fortification, Fort Morgan, on the site of Fort Bowyer.[2]]]></description>

Campbell's Island was the site of the Battle of Rock Island Rapids, one of the westernmost battles of the War of 1812, when a band of approximately 500 Sauk warriors allied with the British Army clashed on July 19, 1814 with an American force led by Lieutenant John Campbell of the 1st U.S. Regiment of Infantry. Campbell was leading three gunboats along the Mississippi River to carry military supplies to Fort Shelby, located at the present site of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.[1] One boat carried 42 people – soldiers of the 1st U.S. Regiment of Infantry and members of their families. The other two boats carried 66 U.S. Rangers. The British-allied Indians attacked the flotilla in their canoes and forced Campbell to turn back.[2] The American loss was 8 men of the 1st Regiment killed and 16 wounded;4 Rangers killed and 8 wounded.[3] This victory helped to enable the Sauk to maintain their control over the Quad Cities area for almost 20 more years. The Campbell's Island State Memorial, dedicated in 1908, commemorates this battle.]]></description>
