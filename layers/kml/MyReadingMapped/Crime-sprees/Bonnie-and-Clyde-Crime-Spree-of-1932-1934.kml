On March 22, 1933, Buck Barrow was granted a full pardon and released from prison. Within days, he and his wife, Blanche, had set up housekeeping with Clyde Barrow, Parker and Jones in a temporaryhideout at 3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive in Joplin, Missouri. According to family sources,[41] Buck and Blanche were there merely to visit, in an attempt to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement. As was common with Bonnie and Clyde, their next brush with the law arose from their generally suspicious—and conspicuous—behavior, not because their identities had been discovered.]]></description>

Unaware of what awaited them, the lawmen assembled only a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront the suspected bootleggers living in the garage apartment. Though taken by surprise, Clyde, noted for remaining cool under fire, was gaining far more experience in gun battles than most lawmen. He, Jones, and Buck quickly killed Detective McGinnis and fatally wounded Constable Harryman.[44][45]]]></description>

On June 10, while driving with Jones and Parker near Wellington, Texas, Barrow missed warning signs at a bridge under construction and flipped their car into a ravine.[4][61] Sources disagree on whether there was an actual gasoline fire[62] or that Parker was doused with acid from the car's battery under the floorboards.[63] What is certain is that Parker sustained serious third degree burns to her right leg. The burn was so severe, the muscles contracted and caused the leg to "draw up".[64] Near the end of her life, Parker could hardly walk and would either hop on her good leg or be carried by Clyde. After getting help from a nearby farm family and kidnapping two local lawmen,[65]]]></description>

To bankroll their stay, on July 18 the outlaws staged a freewheeling — if rather minor-league — crime rampage through the staid streets of Fort Dodge, Iowa, stopping at one gas station after another, ransacking the cash registers and robbing and kidnapping the attendants, shoving them onto the backseat. They also broke open the vending and gumball machines and scooped out all the change, a move which would have unexpected consequences for them several days hence. After three such robberies in fifteen minutes they realized they had no more room for hostages, released everybody, and with a hundred fifty new dollars in their pockets, headed for Kansas City;[6] it was 250 miles distant over 1933 roads, yet they were there in under four hours.]]></description>

At 11 p.m. that night, Sheriff Coffey led a group of officers armed with Thompson submachine guns toward the cabins.[75] But in a pitched gunfight at considerable distances, the submachine guns proved no match for Clyde Barrow's
 preferred Browning Automatic Rifles, stolen July 7 from the National Guard armory at Enid, Oklahoma.[76] The Barrows laid down withering fire and made their escape when a bullet short-circuited the horn on the armored car[77] and the lawmen mistook it for a cease-fire signal. They did not pursue the retreating Barrow automobile.[68]

Although the gang evaded law enforcement once again, Buck Barrow had sustained a horrific through-and-through bullet wound to the side of the head and Blanche Barrow was nearly blinded from glass fragments in both her eyes.[68][78] Their prospects for holding out against the ensuing manhunt dwindled.]]></description>

Five days later, on July 24, the Barrow Gang was camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa.[4][79] Buck's head wound was so severe that Clyde and Jones dug a grave for him.[80] After their bloody bandages were noticed by local citizens, it was determined that the campers were the Barrow gang. Surrounded by local lawmen and approximately one hundred spectators, the Barrows once again found themselves under fire.[79] Clyde Barrow, Parker, and W.D. Jones escaped on foot.[4][79] Buck was shot again, in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers.]]></description>

On November 22, 1933, they again narrowly evaded arrest while attempting to hook up with family members near Sowers, Texas. This time it was their hometown sheriff, Dallas's Smoot Schmid, and his squad, deputies Bob Alcorn and Ted Hinton, lying in wait nearby. As Barrow drove up, he sensed a trap and drove right past his family's car, at which point Schmid and his deputies stood up and opened fire with machine guns and a BAR. The family members in the crossfire were not hit, but a single bullet from the BAR passed through the car, striking the legs of both Barrow and Parker.[84] They escaped that night.]]></description>

On January 16, 1934, Barrow finally made his long-contemplated move against the Texas Department of Corrections as he orchestrated the escape of Raymond Hamilton, Henry Methvin and several others in the infamous "Eastham Breakout" of 1934.[26]

During the jailbreak, escapee Joe Palmer shot prison officer Major Joe Crowson[87]]]></description>

On April 1, 1934, Easter Sunday, Barrow and Henry Methvin killed two young highway patrolmen, H. D. Murphy and Edward Bryant Wheeler, at the intersection of Route 114 and Dove Road near Grapevine, Texas (now the neighboring city of Southlake).[95][96]]]></description>

Public hostility only increased when, five days later, Barrow and Methvin killed 60-year-old Constable William "Cal" Campbell, a widower single father, near Commerce, Oklahoma.[103] They kidnapped Commerce police chief Percy Boyd, drove around with him, crossing the state line into Kansas, and then let him out with a clean shirt, a few dollars and a request from Parker to tell the world she did not smoke cigars. The outlaws did not realize at their upbeat parting that Boyd would identify both Barrow and Parker to authorities—he never learned the name of the sullen youth who was with them—and when the resultant arrest warrant was issued for the Campbell murder, it specified "Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and John Doe."[104] Historian Knight writes: "For the first time, Bonnie was seen as a killer, actually pulling the trigger—just like Clyde. Whatever chance she had for clemency had just been reduced."[101]]]></description>

At approximately 9:15 am on May 23, the posse, concealed in the bushes and almost ready to concede defeat, heard Barrow's stolenFord V8 approaching at a high speed. The posse's official report had Barrow stopping to speak with Henry Methvin's father, planted there with his truck that morning to distract him and force him into the lane closer to the posse. The lawmen then opened fire, killing Barrow and Parker while shooting a combined total of approximately 130 rounds. All accounts of the ambush, including his own, agree that Oakley fired first, and probably before any order was given to do so.[109][111][112] Barrow was killed instantly by Oakley's initial head shot, but Parker had a moment to reflect; Hinton reported hearing her scream as she realized Barrow was dead before the shooting at her began in earnest.[109] The officers emptied the specially ordered automatic rifles, as well as other rifles, shotguns, and pistols at the car,[108] and any one of many wounds would have been fatal to either of the fugitives.[113]]]></description>
