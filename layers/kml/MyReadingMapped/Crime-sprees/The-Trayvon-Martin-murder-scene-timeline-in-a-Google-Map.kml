			<description><![CDATA[For those of you who are unfamiliar with the case, on a cold rainy night on February 26, 2012, an armed 28-year old mixed-race Hispanic Neighborhood Watch coordinator at a gated community in Sanford Florida, suspects a falsely-accused invited guest of "Being up to no good." in his non-emergency 911 call. And despite being told by police to not follow his suspect, George Zimmerman follows the unarmed black 17-year old Trayvon Martin, stating to the non-emergency operator "These assholes always get away."

Setting up a situation where Zimmerman would receive in court the "Presumption of Innocence" that Zimmerman did not consider in his judgement of the falsely-accused Trayvon Martin. This is also a case involving the controversial Florida Stand Your Ground and the self-dense laws that Zimmerman used to justify his shooting Trayvon Martin. Yet, despite all the lies discovered in his videoed testimony, the lack of DNA evidence supporting Zimmerman's claims, and the many unaccounted for details; jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of either second-degree murder or manslaughter.

If you expect police testimony, lab evidence and the like in support of or against George Zimmerman this is not where you will find it. This map cares little whether George Zimmerman had the right to defend himself, but rather the fine line between one person's right to defend his community and another's right to the presumption of innocence when falsely judged by a Neighborhood Watch volunteer. And, how the law applied the presumption of innocence and the right of self-defense to the Neighborhood Watch volunteer and not the volunteer's tracked down suspect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The following letter was emailed to over 40 Florida State Representatives:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dear State Representative,
 
I believe that changes are needed in order to protect citizens against the unintended or unforeseen consequences of the Stand Your Ground and Self-defense laws have resulted death of an innocent victim of a Neighborhood Watch program.
 
The recent George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin trial proved that Florida’s Self-defense and Stand Your Ground laws need additional provisions in order to ensure that innocent citizens are not falsely accused of being a criminal by Neighborhood Watch personnel or other well-intentioned citizens. As you will see in this very detailed Google Map of the Trayvon Martin Murder scene timeline (http://myreadingmapped.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-trayvon-martin-murder-scene.html), George Zimmerman had at least two opportunities to avoid a confrontation with his falsely accused suspect, and that the Stand Your Ground and self-defense laws should have applied to both George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin because Martin had as much to fear of the person stalking him. The Google Map above is the most detailed interactive map to date in that it plots Zimmerman’s reenactment video by each location, plots each personal phone call, each 911 call and where the street lights are, when the police entered the Retreat at Twin Lakes and where the police were in the facility when the shot was fired. It appears from the officer’s arrival time on the scene, had the officer left his patrol car when he drove passed Zimmerman’s car, in 30 seconds time he would have been able to intervene just as the fight between Zimmerman and Martin began. Had Zimmerman remained at the mail box as he told the non-emergency operator he would, this tragedy would never have happened.
 
As this case shows, unintended or unforeseen consequences of the Stand Your Ground and Self-defense laws have resulted death of an innocent victim of a Neighborhood Watch program, as a result these laws need amending to include the following provisions:
- Hold Neighborhood Watch programs accountable when they incorrectly judge an innocent person as a criminal suspect. 
- Hold armed, gun-toting, Neighborhood Watch programs accountable for their actions when their actions result in bodily harm or death. 
- Self-defense law provisions should not be allowed in situations where the shooter tracked, followed or stalked the victim. 
- Stand Your Ground and Self-defense laws should apply to the victim as well as the shooter, and an investigation should determine whether the victim felt threatened by the person claiming self-defense. 
- Those claiming Self-defense, must prove they made an attempt to flee their attacker before using deadly force, or prove they used methods to incapacitate their attacker rather than kill the attacker. 
- Make it mandatory that all claims of Self-defense be investigated in depth just like any other crime or police officer who fired his weapon.
Sincerely,


<Your Name and address, etc.>]]></description>

Florida To Hold 'Stand Your Ground' Hearings After Will Weatherford Agrees To Revisit Law (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/florida-stand-your-ground-hearing_n_3698686.html)

Florida lawmakers will hold hearings this fall on the state's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law, which has become a lightning rod for criticism following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

According to announcement on Friday by Will Weatherford, the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives,

"Across Florida, representatives are receiving calls, letters, visits and emails from constituents with diverse opinions on 'Stand Your Ground,'" Weatherford said. "Passions are high, but every person has the right to express their views on this matter of great importance."]]></description>

Florida Senate Panel Approves 'Stand Your Ground' Revisions (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/florida-stand-your-ground_n_4071133.html?ref=topbar)

The bill approved Tuesday requires local sheriffs to issue guidelines to neighborhood crime watch programs, particularly that participants are prohibited from pursuing and confronting suspects.

It also further clarifies existing language in 'Stand Your Ground' that individuals acting as aggressors are barred from using the law as a defense, and removes language so that any bystanders injured by 'Stand Your Ground' fire can pursue civil action.

However, the bill never made it out of committee.]]></description>

A report by Zimmerman's doctor made public in July on O'Mara's website shows Zimmerman was also taking Adderall, a psychostimulant used for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Omeprazole, a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 
Thus, should a person with ADHD own a gun, and should they be a Neighborhood Watch coordinator if he can't remember the street names in his community. What happens when he forgets to take his drugs? ]]></description>

reuters.com (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/28/us-usa-florida-shooting-idUSBRE95Q0EE20130628)

"Good initially told police the person on top was pummeling the other in mixed martial arts style, but backed off that account, later saying the person on top was straddling the other man, but his arms might have been holding the other down rather than punching.

Asked by state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda if he saw the "person on top" grabbing the head of the lighter skinned man and slamming it into the concrete, Good replied "No."

In opening statements, defense attorney Don West told the court "Trayvon Martin armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to smash George Zimmerman's head ... That is a deadly weapon."

Under cross-examination Good was asked why he had clarified his initial description about blows being struck. "That's what it looked like," Good said. But because it was dark outside, Good said "I can't 100 percent confirm that that was happening."]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Stalking)

Stalking is a distinctive form of criminal activity composed of a series of actions that taken individually might constitute legal behavior. For example, sending flowers, writing love notes, and waiting for someone outside her place of work are actions that, on their own, are not criminal. When these actions are coupled with an intent to instill fear or injury, however, they may constitute a pattern of behavior that is illegal. Though anti-stalking laws are gender neutral, most stalkers are men and most victims are women.]]></description>

"You will add your “eyes and ears” to those of the Police Department which cannot be everywhere, all the time, by keeping a watchful eye and open ear to what is happening in your neighborhood. You will extend their ability to provide security by reporting anything unusual or suspicious, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so they can follow up on your leads. What you will not do is get physically involved with any activity you report or apprehension of any suspicious persons. This is the job of the law enforcement agency."

			<description><![CDATA[If Trayvon Martin was sitting on (straddling) George Zimmerman and pounding his head as witness John Good claims, how does George Zimmerman get to his gun when the gun is hidden behind Zimmerman's back, inside his pants waistline Martin is supposedly sitting on. The only way Zimmerman could get to his gun, with a 150 lb. person sitting on him, is if Martin got off Zimmerman or was rolled over on to his side. Are we to assume Zimmerman had his jacket open on a cold rainy night? Or, did he already have his gun out and what witness John Good perceived in the dark as pounding Zimmerman's head was instead trying to wrestle the gun out of Zimmerman's hand by slamming his hand on the grass and that those head wounds are the result of this fight for the gun? Since Zimmerman cannot account for how the fight moved 40 feet south, or for the gap in time, or his ignoring police instructions, for me at least, there are way too many possibilities to take Zimmerman at his word. So had I been a juror, I would have had to apply reasonable doubt to the truthfulness of George Zimmerman's testimony.]]></description>

That would have immediately ended the situation. But Zimmerman instead let Trayvon go and built up his fears in his mind as time went on.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The court unfairly holds jurors to a higher standard than the court itself.

- Jurors can be sequestered, yet the the defendant, the lawyers and the judge are not. In the Zimmerman case it was proven in court that attorneys improperly influenced witnesses who were supposed to be sequestered and that one witness was improperly influenced by court testimony he improperly witnessed only days before he decided to be a witness himself favoring the defendant. In another situation, witnesses who were under recall participated in editing a defendant's animation being presented by an artist who had yet to testify.
- The lawyers job is not justice, but win at all costs even if it means lying and distortion of the facts, and expect jurors to decide what are the facts and what are the lies.
- The court restricts juror verdicts to the interpretation of the law provided in its instructions to the jury, yet the court does not provide the jurors with an impartial attorney to assist jurors in understanding confusing, often compromised and watered down instructions worked out between the prosecutor and the defendant's attorney. Thus, in the Zimmerman case the jurors must have felt the court of no help in resolving understanding what manslaughter is when the court didn't answer the jury's question, but instead responded by asking for specific questions. It was at that point that half the jurors gave up hope of finding justice in favor of reasonable doubt and ending their month long sequestered lifestyle, Yet in the Zimmerman case, two of the jurors were wives of attorneys who had an unfair advantage over the other jurors in that they may have been influenced by their husbands in the days prior to the trial.]]></description>
