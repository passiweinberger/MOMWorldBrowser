			<description><![CDATA[http://www.cultclinic.org/qa2.html

An estimated 5 to 7 million Americans have been involved in cults, or cult-like groups.

The total number of these groups ranges from 3,000 to 5,000. It is hard to get a precise number as cults change their names, splinter off into other groups, or shut down in one area only to open back up in another.

There are approximately 180,000 new cult recruits every year.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmental_lists_of_cults_and_sects)

The application of the labels (cults or sects) to religious movements in government documents usually signifies the popular and negative use of the term "cult" in English and a functionally similar use of words translated as "sect" in several European languages.[1][2] Government reports which have used these words include those from Austria,[3] Belgium,[4]Canada,[5] France[6] (in 1995), Germany, and the United States. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe the groups.[1]]]></description>

			<name>Fascism: common human traits of utopias</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[When one considers why a group of people would isolate themselves from the rest of society in order to govern themselves in a purer community as they see it, the following criteria seems appropriate as a basic human trait common to most utopias. Some of the utopias moved so far out west to ungoverned territories beyond the reach of the government established by the American Revolution. Thus, no government other than themselves mattered to them.
 
According to Howard Paxton’s landmark study “The Anatomy of Fascism”, the signs of fascism are as follows:

- A sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions.
- The primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior in every right, both universal and personal, and subordination of the individual to it. Subordinate all kinds of civil rights and free speech to the patriotic identity.
- The belief that the group is victimized, which justifies any action without legal or moral limits against the group’s perceived enemies, both internal and external.
- Dread of the group’s decline under the corrosive effect of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences.
- The need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary.
- The need for authority by natural leaders, culminating in a national chief who alone is capable of incarnating the group’s identity.
- The superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason.
- The beauty of violence and efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group’s success.
- The right of the ‘chosen people’ to dominate others without restraint from any human or divine law, “right” being decided solely by the group’s prowess in a Darwinian struggle, the need for closer integration of a purer community.]]></description>

Acorn Community (http://www.acorncommunity.org/)
 
Acorn Community is an anarchist, egalitarian, intentional community located in rural Virginia, USA and is a member of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities . Acorn was started in 1993 as a spin-off community of the older, larger Twin Oak. For reasons not entirely clear, the early 1990s saw a surge in interest in intentional communities. The Twin Oaks population swelled to capacity and Acorn was born. The population and stability of Acorn has fluctuated significantly in its relatively short history. Financial crisis and interpersonal conflict have brought the community close to an end on a number of occasions. However, having survived these difficult times, Acorn is now thriving (2013) with a waiting list of people who have been approved to become members when a space becomes available. Acorn supports itself through its non-GMO heirloom seed business (Southern Exposure Seed Exchange). The income from this business is shared among its members.]]></description>

World Brotherhood Colonies are an idea for cooperative spiritual living first promoted by Paramahansa Yogananda, the Indian yogi and author of Autobiography of a Yogi. Beginning in 1932 (long before the intentional community movement of the late 1960s), and continuing to the end of his life in 1952, Yogananda urged young people to pool their resources, buy land, and build spiritual communities where they could live a life of "plain living and high thinking." Yogananda tried to establish World Brotherhood Colonies at his retreat centers in Southern California, but they eventually were turned into monasteries for monks and nuns of Self-Realization Fellowship.]]></description>

It was originally founded in 1918 in Hyūga, in the mountains of Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyūshū, but in 1939 they were warned that much of their land was about to be submerged by the construction of a dam, so they searched for a new home and found 10 hectares in Moroyama-mach, Iruma-gun, Saitama Prefecture. A few members remain at Hyūga to this day, but they are still to a certain extent dependent on the Saitama community and support from "external members".]]></description>

The village was founded in 1846 by Swedish immigrants affiliated with the Pietist movement, led by Erik Jansson. Prior to founding the Bishop Hill Colony, Jansson preached to his followers in Sweden about what he considered to be the abominations of the Lutheran Church and emphasized the doctrine that the faithful were without sin. As Jansson's ideas became more radical, he began to lose support from many of his sympathizers and was forced to leave Sweden in the midst of growing persecution. Jansson had previously sent Olof Olsson, a trusted follower, as an emissary to the United States to find a suitable location where the Janssonists could set up a utopian community centered around their religious beliefs. According to Jansson, this community would become the "New Jerusalem", and their beliefs would soon spread across the world. As a result, 1400 colonists emigrated from Sweden to their new home in western Illinois.]]></description>

Brights Grove was the site of Canada's first commune.  In 1829, Brights Grove was established along the model of Robert Owen's New Lanark, Scotland project by Henry Jones (1776–1852). The colony was named 'Maxwell' and was a short-lived project. However, it has been argued by Canadian socialist historian Ian McKay that "[t]he builders of the short-lived colony named Maxwell that Jones planted near Sarnia may well have been the first people in North America to call themselves 'socialists'."]]></description>

It was founded by former Unitarian minister George Ripley and his wife Sophia Ripley at the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts (9 miles outside of downtown Boston) in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of Transcendentalism, a religious and cultural philosophy based in New England.

Bunkerville was settled in 1877 by Mormon pioneers from Utah. It is named after Edward Bunker, who was already a seasoned pioneer settler before he came to Bunkerville, having pioneered the settlement at Santa Clara, Utah.[2]
 
Bunker, on his own initiative but with permission from Brigham Young, moved his large polygamous family 25 miles (40 km) southwest to Bunkerville after the settlers in Santa Clara had failed to live the communitarian United Order. The residents of Bunkerville, so named by Brigham Young, established a new communal effort, sharing the work and the fruits of their work, with all land being held in common. The communal experiment ended in 1880.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned-over_district)

The burned-over district was the religious scene in the western and central regions of New York in the early 19th century, where religious revivals and Pentecostal movements of the Second Great Awakening took place.[1]


The term was coined by Charles Grandison Finney who in his 1876 book Autobiography of Charles G. Finneyreferred to a "burnt district" to denote an area in central and western New York State during the Second Great Awakening. The name was inspired by the notion that the area had been so heavily evangelized as to have no "fuel" (unconverted population) left over to "burn" (convert).]]></description>

On his arrival in Croton, he quickly attained extensive influence, and many people began to follow him. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speech in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.[37]                                                                                
His followers established a select brotherhood or club for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic practices developed by their master. The accounts agree that what was done and taught among the members was kept a profound secret. The esoteric teachings may have concerned the secret religious doctrines and usages, which were undoubtedly prominent in the Pythagorean system, and may have been connected with the worship of Apollo.[38] Temperance of all kinds seems to have been strictly urged. There is disagreement among the biographers as to whether Pythagoras forbade all animal food,[39] or only certain types.[40] The club was in practice at once "a philosophical school, a religious brotherhood, and a political association.]]></description>

Estero was established and incorporated by the followers of Dr. Cyrus Reed Teed, who proposed a theory that we live on the inside of the Earth's outer skin, and that celestial bodies are all contained inside the hollow Earth. This theory, which he called Koreshan Unity, drew followers to purchase and occupy a 320-acre (1.3 km2) tract in 1894. They were business-oriented and lived communally, prospering enough to found its own political party ("The Progressive Liberty Party") and incorporate the town in 1904 as Estero. The 1908 death of Dr. Teed (who claimed to be immortal) was a critical blow to the group's faith, whose membership dwindled into the 1960s. The Foundation remains as "The College of Life Foundation," which contributed (for example) at least $25,000 to the Gulf Shore Playhouse in or around 2007.[7]  The Koreshans' original tract is now owned by Florida as the Koreshan State Historic Site .]]></description>

On Henry Ford's 150th Birthday, a Look Inside His Failed Utopia  (http://gizmodo.com/on-henry-fords-150th-birthday-a-look-inside-his-faile-965248212?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gizmodo%2Ffull+%28Gizmodo%29)
 
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordl%C3%A2ndia)

Ford intended to use Fordlândia to provide his company with a source of rubber for the tires on Ford cars, avoiding the dependence on British (Malayan) rubber. The land was hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford's managers had the requisite knowledge of tropical agriculture. The rubber trees, packed closely together in plantations, as opposed to being widely spaced in the jungle, were easy prey for tree blight, sauva ants, lace bugs, red spiders, and leaf caterpillars,[2] a problem absent from the Asian rubber plantations, where transplanted Amazonian rubber trees faced no natural predators. The mostly indigenous workers on the plantations, given unfamiliar food such as hamburgers and forced to live in American-style housing, disliked the way they were treated—they had to wear ID badges, and work through the middle of the day under the tropical sun—and would often refuse to work. In 1930 the native workers revolted against the managers, many of whom fled into the jungle for a few days until the Brazilian Armyarrived and the revolt ended.[3]                                                                    
Ford forbade alcohol, women and tobacco within the town, including inside the workers' own homes. The inhabitants circumvented this prohibition by paddling out to merchant riverboats moored beyond town jurisdiction[4] and a settlement was established five miles upstream on the "Island of Innocence" with bars, nightclubs and brothels.

Nazism Between Utopia and Anti-Utopia  
 
On the one hand, Nazism was clearly a utopian movement. It wanted to create a perfect world for the pure Aryan race, devoid of degenerating forces. In a sense, it was idealistic. It had an ideal view of humanity and wanted to realize it, in part by way of the destruction of the less than ideal human beings and of those who were considered enemies of and dangerous to the better humans. Nazism had a peculiar kind of love for humanity. It’s love for humanity implied the destruction of those who abase, bring down and pollute it. Humanity was of course defined in a very particular way: true humans were the Aryans. The love for Aryans rather than hatred of Jews and other inferior beings was the prime motive. Love was what mattered, not hate, sadism, rancor or revenge. The future mattered, not our origins. People’s origins and race mattered only to the extent that racial mixing would threaten the future existence of the better race. And although there was blind and violent rage, the Nazi killings were in general rational, dutiful, professional, organized, and framed in terms of self-defense against degenerating forces.]]></description>

The Latter Day Saint movement (also called the LDS movement or LDS restorationist movement) is the collection of independent church groups that trace their origins to a Christian primitivist movement founded byJoseph Smith in the late 1820s. Collectively, these churches have over 14 million members. The vast majority of members belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), with their predominant theology being Mormonism. The LDS Church self-identifies as Christian.[1] A minority of Latter Day Saint adherents, such as members of the Community of Christ, believe in traditional Protestant theology, and have distanced themselves from some of the distinctive doctrines of Mormonism. Other breakaway groups include theRemnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which support lineal succession of leadership of Joseph Smith's descendants; and the more controversial Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, who defend the practice of polygamy.]]></description>

Several structures were constructed using local granite boulders and lumber, including a hotel, meeting house, and water storage tank. There was also a small open aqueduct made of granite cobbles and cement. The remnants of the built features are still visible at the site, which has been abandoned for decades.]]></description>

Co-op members privately own their own homesteads, which range in size from 1 acre (0.4 hectares) to several acres each. Over 90 acres (nearly 40 hectares) are maintained as a nature preserve—the Common Land owned collectively and enjoyed by the entire membership.

			<description><![CDATA[Wikpedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites)

The Millerites were the followers of the teachings of William Miller who, in 1833, first shared publicly his belief in the coming Second Advent of Jesus Christ in roughly the year 1843.

Miller was a prosperous farmer, a Baptist lay preacher and student of the Bible, living in northern New York, in the region of that state which has come to be known as the Burned-over district. Through years of intensive study of symbolic meaning of the prophecies of Daniel and using the year-day method of prophetic interpretation, Miller became convinced that the date of Christ's Second Coming was revealed in Bible prophecy. In September 1822, Miller formally stated his conclusions in a twenty-point document, including article 15, "I believe that the second coming of Jesus Christ is near, even at the door, even within twenty-one years,—on or before 1843."[1] This document however, remained private for many years.]]></description>

Nashoba Commune was an experimental project of Fanny Wright, initiated in 1825 to educate and emancipate slaves. It was located in a 2,000-acre (8 km²) woodland on the side of present-day Germantown, Tennessee, a Memphis suburb, along the Wolf River. It was a small-scale test of her full-compensation emancipation plan in which no slaveholders would lose money for emancipating slaves. Instead, Wright proposed that, through a system of unified labor, the slaves would buy their freedom and then be transported to the independent settlements of Liberia and Haiti. ]]></description>

In the early years of the Jesus Fellowship, a residential Christian community was founded for its growing membership. Initially a large Anglican rectory in Bugbrooke was purchased and renamed “New Creation Hall”. Several members of the Jesus Fellowship moved in and it became the first centre of a community lifestyle. By 1979, several other large houses in the surrounding area were purchased and “New Creation Christian Community,”  as the entire community was named, was established, with some 350 residents.[23]  Today there are around 60 New Creation Christian Community houses in the UK with about 700 people – about 25 per cent of the total membership of the Jesus Fellowship – living in them.]]></description>

New Lanark is a village on the River Clyde ,approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometres) from Lanark, in South Lanarkshire, and some 40 km southeast of Glasgow, Scotland. It was founded in 1786 by David Dale, who built cotton mills and housing for the mill workers. Dale built the mills there in a brief partnership with the English inventor and entrepreneur Richard Arkwright to take advantage of the water power provided by the only waterfalls on the River Clyde. Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale's son-in-law, Robert Owen, a Welsh philanthropist and social reformer, New Lanark became a successful business and an epitome of utopian socialism as well as an early example of a planned settlement and so an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.]]></description>

Nimbin is notable for the prominence of its environmental initiatives such as permaculture, sustainability,  self-sufficiency as well as the cannabis counterculture. Writer Austin Pick described his initial impressions of the village this way: "It is as if a smoky avenue of Amsterdam has been placed in the middle of the mountains behind frontier-style building facades. ... Nimbin is a strange place indeed."[2]    

Nimbin has been described in literature and mainstream media as 'the drug capital of Australia', 'a social experiment' and 'an escapist sub-culture'. Nimbin has become an icon in Australian cultural history with many of the values first introduced there by the counterculture becoming part of modern Australian culture.[3]  ]]></description>

The original intent was to build Vegetarian Colony on the south side of the Neosho River for vegetarians only, but investor interest in a non-vegetarian moral community was much higher and so the decision was made to build Octagon City on the north side of the Neosho River to make the entire project sustainable. Members of Octagon City were under oath to educate their children and uphold a moral lifestyle.]]></description>

It played a central role in King Philip's War, one of the earliest of the Indian Wars. Ultimately, the colony was merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony nd other territories in 1691 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay .]]></description>

The Oneida Community was a religious commune founded by John Humphrey Noyes in 1848 in Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus's millennial kingdom themselves, and be free of sin and perfect in this world, not just Heaven (a belief calledPerfectionism). The Oneida Community practiced Communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions),Complex Marriage, Male Continence, Mutual Criticism and Ascending Fellowship. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont.[1] The community's original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until devastated by a tornado in 1878. The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, and eventually became the giant silverware company Oneida Limited.[2]]]></description>

The community had its beginnings in 1941 when a group of Christian Pacifists agreed to adopt a way of life based on co-operation. They wanted to demonstrate that this was a practical alternative to the competitive ways of normal society which are a major contributor to wars. One of the group contributed 30 acres of farmland and orchard, in the Lower Moutere Valley, and some of them moved there to live. Several of the founding members were conscientious objectors to the compulsory military scheme during the Second World War. These men spent the war years on a prison farm in the Taranaki region while their wives and children moved to the small farm in Lower Moutere.

Today Riverside consists of 208 hectares of both flat and rolling hill land, with our main income coming from our dairy farm. We manage a growing number of secondary businesses including a café, centre, garage, pear orchard, organic gardens and shop. Income is shared and distributed depending on family size rather than occupation. Riverside assets are owned by the Trust and there is no private ownership of houses or cars. The community's general fund helps to meet basic needs such as health care, dental care, electricity and phone while other needs are subsidised like education and travel costs.]]></description>

The colony moved to a slightly more permanent second settlement on an old farm five miles north from 1896 to 1899, and saw another brief incarnation near Waycross, in southern Georgia, from 1899 until it finally dissolved in 1901. Its regional location within the Southern United States set it apart from many other similar utopian projects of the era. At its high point, the population was around 250. The colony was named after John Ruskin, the English socialist writer. A cave on the colony's second property in Dickson County still carries his name.]]></description>

Shaker Heights was incorporated as a village in 1912. The name "Shaker Heights" has origins in two local sources. The community was laid out on land formerly owned by the North Union Community of the United Society of Believers, more commonly known as Shakers. "Heights" refers to the plateau east of Cleveland that rises sharply in elevation from 582 feet above sea level at the base of the Cedar Glen Parkway rising to 950 feet above sea level in nearby Cleveland Heights ; Shaker Heights' elevation is 1050 feet above sea level.]]></description>

In December 1806, forty-four converts of legal age signed a covenant agreeing to mutual support and the common ownership of property. They began living together on the 140 acres (57 ha) farm of Elisha Thomas, whose lands formed the nucleus of the Pleasant Hill Shaker village. Additional converts and property were quickly added, with the community occupying 4,369 acres (1,768 ha). By 1812 three communal families—East, Center, and West—had been formed, and a fourth, North, was established as a "gathering family" for prospective converts. On June 2, 1814, 128 Believers bound themselves together in a more formal covenant, which established the community in the pattern of the Shaker Ministry's village at New Lebanon, New York.]]></description>

Financial difficulties continued to plague the group. After they worked for free for two years on the Capilano Bridge project, the Kalevan Kansa was disbanded.

The Minnesota Experimental City (MXC) was a proposed planned community  to be located in northern Minnesota (near Swatara in Aitkin County. Proposed and studied beginning in the 1960s, it would have been constructed as a public private partnership. In contrast with many of the model cities of the time, the MXC was to be experimental, trying new things rather than proposing to select from the best of the existing practice.                                                                                         
It was designed for 250,000 people over 60,000 acres (24,000 ha). In the plan, only 1/6 of the area would be paved, the remainder would be open space parks, wilderness, and farms. The plan called for the MXC to be partially enclosed by a geodesic dome. It would contain a branch of the University of Minnesota and 3M.

Among other proposed features were:
- a pedestrian zone, cars were to be parked on the edge with a people-mover connecting them to the center. An automated highway system  would connect the town with the outside world.
- no schools. The city itself would foster lifelong learning, with everyone both a student and teacher.
- waterless toilets  ]]></description>

George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison held Utopian viewpoints.

Thomas Jefferson penned these immortal words: "We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness."

Thomas Jefferson got repealed all the direct federal taxes passed by the Federalists and boasted that ordinary Americans would never see a federal tax collector in their whole lives. 

James Madison stated this: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article in the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents."

In the Utopian States, the rights of individuals to have employment or an income stream is as fundamental as the right of individuals to accumulate wealth and not be taxed.]]></description>

In 1983, charges were brought against Charles "Eddie" Wiseman (an elder in the group) for misdemeanor  simple assault; this, combined with multiple child custody cases, formed the basis of a search warrant. On June 22, 1984 Vermont State Police and Vermont Social Rehabilitation Services seized 112 children;[2]  all were released the same day while the raid was ruled unconstitutional.[22]  Due to what the group perceived as massive misunderstanding of the events and concerns leading up to and surrounding the raid, they began formal relationships with their neighbors.[1]  Two months after the raid, the case against Wiseman fell apart after the main witness recanted, saying he was under duress from the anticult movement . The case was later dropped in 1985 after a judge ruled that Wiseman had been denied his right to a speedy trial. Eddie Wiseman's public defender, Jean Swantko, who had been present during the raid, later joined and married Wiseman.]]></description>

It is an intentional community and an international seminar centre aiming to develop and implement practical models for a socially and ecologically sustainable way of living. To do this, it integrates personal growth work, the establishment of a cooperative and environment-friendly way of living and participation in political issues. In particular, ZEGG focuses on exploring innovative approaches to love and sexuality and it has developed and practices the use of tools for personal expression and trust building in large groups, including the ZEGG Forum.                                                                               
ZEGG was founded in 1991 on a 37-acre site (15 hectares), where approx. 100 people now live, including 15 children and youth (as of 2011). The facilities on site include: an ecological sewage plan,  a CO2-neutral heating system, organic vegetable garden, some clay buildings, a meditation room, artists’ studios, workshops, a guesthouse, the "Children’s Building" and a range of other rooms and facilities for events and seminars.]]></description>

The Zihuatanejo Project was a psychedelic training center and intentional community created during the beginning of the counterculture of the 1960s  by Timothy Leary  and Richard Alpert  under the umbrella of their nonprofit group, the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF). The community was located in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Mexico, and took up residence at the Hotel Catalina in the summers of 1962 and 1963.[1]  ]]></description>
