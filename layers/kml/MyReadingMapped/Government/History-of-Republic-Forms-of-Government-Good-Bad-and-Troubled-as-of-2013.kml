Originally this map did not have descriptions embedded in this map. Instead it simply linked to descriptions on Wikipedia to keep it current and accurate. However, that made this map difficult to use, so I updated it with concise descriptions from Wikipedia. Doing this now requires a lot of work maintaining it's accuracy due the constant change of politics worldwide. Which I am unable to do satisfactory.]]></description>

			<name>What is a Republic?</name>

			<description><![CDATA[Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic)

A republic is a form of government in which power is held by the people and the representatives they elect,[1] and affairs of state are a "public matter" (from Latin: res publica), rather than privately accommodated (such as through inheritance or divine mandate). In modern times the definition of a republic is also commonly limited to a government which excludes a monarch.[2][1] Currently, 135 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official names.
 
However, as you will see from reading the following Republic placemarks and the problems and troubles of many of them, almost any form of government can hide within the frame work of a Republic, including the United States.]]></description>

			<name>Is a Republic a Democracy?</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[Yes and No. According to Wikipedia, a democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination.

However, in my opinion as a former middle-of-the-road elected common councilman, this process creates an elite elected-meritocracy that takes on a life of it's own and decides which of the many differing opinions there are in the electorate to give importance and priority. As a result it is susceptible to corruption, bribery, lobbying and the influence of a corporate oligarchy that feeds off of government. And, can enable a minority of the population to control the majority of the population.
 
In reality, what we have is a Republic with Democratic principles that puts the power in the hands of a minority of politically-influential and wealthy individuals. Yet, this is the closest we will ever get to self-determination in a society where our livelihood is no longer that of a self-sufficient 1776 colonial farmer and is now dependent on employment by those who hold the real power in a modern Republic.]]></description>

			<name>What are the bad things about Republic forms of government?</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[- As the case studies in this map will indicate, power and money are a corrupting force no matter what form of government you have.

- Despite the fact that our governing officials are supposed to be representatives of the electorate, once in power the elected officials respond more to the needs of their corporate sponsors -- who funded their campaigns -- than they do to the needs of the people they govern. Thus a hidden corporate oligarchy rules within a representative republic.  

- That portion of the political spectrum that elected these public officials represent only one faction of the people the governing body is supposed to govern fairly and equally. But it never seems to turn out fair and equal. One faction, the one that elected the official, always benefits at the expense of the others. 

- Many republics prefer a hands-off free-market economy. Yet within that free-market economy a great many corporations profit from their ties with and intervening in government either by creating legislation, regulations or deregulation to their benefit, tax breaks, government subsidies, research grants, or doing business with various government agencies. Thus, unlike the separation of church and state in the U.S., you cannot separate the corporate interests from governing in a Republic governed by an elite elected body who are basically owned by their corporate sponsors.

- When things get out of hand, the economy turns into a plutonomy and there develops a greater separation of wealth between the common man or woman and the wealthy elite who can increase their power through political campaign funding.]]></description>

- Republics are good when the governing body treats the needs of all the people fairly and equally.                                                                                         
- Republics are good when business and government work together for the good of the economy and the middle class.                                                 
- Republics are good when the various political factions can compromise and work together for a common goal that is fair and just for all.]]></description>

			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[There is a growing worldwide divide growing where no faction seems to be able to share governing with other factions and be able to compromise for the benefit of all. That is why they choose a Republic form of government rather than a pure democracy. But the very nature of politics in a Republic creates an elite governing body that can sell its influence and power to the highest bidder.

- What seems to be developing are utopias designed to benefit the perceived purer community of extremists.                                                        
- Where one group claims they are oppressed by government restrictions and regulation, yet will use government to restrict and regulate others to achieve the goal of the self perceived oppress utopians.                                                                                        
- You can see it in the Middle East conflict between Israel and Palestine, you can see it in how Iraq is so divided they cannot form a reasonable government, you can see it in how the U.S. Congress is so stalemated it cannot agree on anything and resulted in a government shutdown of what they perceive is the greatest form of government.                                                                                
- The misperceptions by both Americans and those overseas about the effectiveness of the U.S. version of a Republic. Americans perceive their chaotic system should work as well as it does worldwide when it cannot considering other cultural factors overseas without adapting to those cultural factors. American's blindly and patriotically think their government is the best in the world despite its chaotic nature and that it should be forced on other countries even if it means going to war to achieve it.]]></description>

The Roman Republic (Latin: Res Pvblica Romana) was the period of the ancient Roman civilization when the government operated as a republic. It began with the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, traditionally dated around 509 BC, and its replacement by a government headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by asenate. A complex constitution gradually developed, centered on the principles of a separation of powers and checks and balances. Except in times of dire national emergency, public offices were limited to one year, so that, in theory at least, no single individual wielded absolute power over his fellow citizens.]]></description>

Only scattered reports of the Licchavi government system survive. The introductory portions of the Cullakalinga Jātaka and the Ekapaṇṇa Jātaka mention the Licchavi as having 7,707Rājās. The number is one of convention, and unlikely to have been exact. It does demonstrate that Licchavi, unlike most of its neighbours, was not an absolute monarchy. Ultimate authority rested with the 7,707 raja who met each year to elect one of their member as ruler and a council of nine to assist him. It was far from a democracy as only a small portion of the Licchavi population qualified to vote. Those with raja status were only the male heads of households who belonged to the kshatriya varna.[7]]]></description>

Mahājanapada (Sanskrit: महाजनपद, Mahājanapada, literally "great realm" from maha, "great", and janapada "foothold of a tribe", "country") refers to ancient Indian kingdoms that existed between the sixth and third centuries BCE. Ancient Buddhist texts like Anguttara Nikaya[1] make frequent reference to sixteen great kingdoms and republics (Solas Mahajanapadas) which had evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Anga in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region,[2] prior to the rise of Buddhism in India.[3] The sixth century BC is often regarded as a major turning point in early Indian history.]]></description>

The city and its territory were originally part of the larger ducatus Neapolitanus, governed by a patrician, but it extracted itself fromByzantine vassalage and first elected a duke in 958. It rose to become an economic powerhouse, a commercial centre whose merchants dominated Mediterranean and Italiantrade for a century before being surpassed and superseded by the other maritime republics of the North, like Pisa, Venice, and Genoa. In 1073, Amalfi lost its independence and fell to the Normans, from whose yoke it failed in two separate attempts to free itself.]]></description>

These senators, the first real senators since the 7th century (the senatorial title had become a meaningless adjunct title of nobility by then), elected as their leader Giordano Pierleoni, son of the Roman consul Pier Leoni with the title patrician, because consulwas also a deprecated noble styling.]]></description>

Pskov, known at various times as the Principality of Pskov (Russian: Псковское княжество, Pskovskoye knyazhestvo) or the Pskov Republic (Russian: Псковская Республика, Pskovskaya Respublika), was a medieval state on the south shore of Lake Pskov. The capital city, also named Pskov, was located at the southern end of thePeipus–Pskov Lake system at the southeast corner of Ugandi, about 150 miles (240 km) southwest of Nevanlinna, and 100 miles (160 km) west-southwest of Great Novgorod. It was originally known as Pleskov, and is now roughly equivalent geographically to the Pskov Oblast of Russia. It was a principality 862–1230s and then joined to Novgorod Republic. From 1348 Pleskov became again independent from Novgorod and established an aristocratic oligarchy.]]></description>

Cospaia was a small republic in Italy, located in northern Umbria, independent from 1440 to 1826. It unexpectedly gained independence in 1440 after Pope Eugene IV, embroiled in a struggle with the Council of Basel, made a sale of territory to the Republic of Florence. By error, a small strip of land went unmentioned in the sale treaty and its inhabitants promptly declared themselves independent. An early centre in Italy for tobacco production, Cospaia eventually deteriorated into a mere smugglers' state which, in 1826, was divided between Tuscany and the Papal States.]]></description>

The region stretches across the lower Dnieper river. At one point the area was a condominium of both the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire. Soon after the colonization of Sich by the Russian Empire with South Slavs and Moldavians (see New Serbia), the Sich was liquidated.[clarification needed] With the liquidation the area became part of the Novorossia.]]></description>

The Commonwealth, or Commonwealth of England, was the period from 1649 onwards when England, along later with Ireland and Scotland,[1] was ruled as a republic following the end of the Second English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I. The republic's existence was initially declared through "An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth",[2] adopted by the Rump Parliament on 19 May 1649. Power in the early Commonwealth was vested primarily in the Parliament and a Council of State. During the period, fighting continued, particularly in Ireland and Scotland, between the parliamentary forces and those opposed to them, as part of what is now referred to as the Third English Civil War.]]></description>

Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
Between 2007 and 2009, Nicaragua's major political parties discussed the possibility of going from a presidential system to a parliamentary system. Their reason: there would be a clear differentiation between the head of government (Prime Minister) and the head of state (President). Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal was to find a legal way for current President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012 (this is when his second and last government period ends).]]></description>

Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982, when a long string of military coups came to an end. Presidents Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85) andVíctor Paz Estenssoro (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada in 2003 and Carlos Mesa in 2005. Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, National Democratic Action, and the Revolutionary Left Movement predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is Evo Morales, the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.]]></description>

The government exercises executive power pursuant to the Constitution of Estonia and the laws of the Republic of Estonia and consists of twelve ministers, including the prime minister. The prime minister also has the right to appoint other ministers and assign them a subject to deal with. These are ministers without portfolio—they don't have a ministry to control.

The Parliament of Estonia (Estonian: Riigikogu) or the legislative branch is elected by people for a four-year term by proportional representation. The Estonian political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1992 constitutional document. The Estonian parliament has 101 members and influences the governing of the state primarily by determining the income and the expenses of the state (establishing taxes and adopting the budget). At the same time the parliament has the right to present statements, declarations and appeals to the people of Estonia, ratify and denounce international treaties with other states and international organisations and decide on the Government loans.[97]]]></description>

The official language was German,[30] although the usage of Polish was guaranteed by law.[31][32] The political parties in the Free City corresponded with the political parties in Weimar Germany; the most influential parties in the 1920s were the conservativeGerman National People's Party, the Social Democratic Party of the Free City of Danzig and the Catholic Centre Party. A Communist Party was founded in 1921 with its origins in the Spartacus League and the Communist Party of East Prussia. Several liberal parties and Free Voter's Associations existed and ran in the elections with varying success. A Polish Party represented the Polish minority and received between 3% (1933) and 6% (1920) of the vote (in total, 4,358 votes in 1933 and 9,321 votes in 1920).[33]]]></description>

Turkey is a parliamentary representative democracy. Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey has developed a strong tradition of secularism.[63] Turkey's constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralized state.

The President of the Republic is the head of state and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections. Abdullah Gül was elected as president on 28 August 2007, by a popular parliament round of votes.[64]

Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers which make up the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others.[65]]]></description>

The Commonwealth had its own constitution, which remained effective until 1973,[35] and was self-governing[10] although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required the approval of the American President.[36]

During the 1935–41 period, the Commonwealth of the Philippines featured a very strong executive, a unicameral National Assembly,[37][38] and a Supreme Court,[39] all composed entirely of Filipinos, as well as an elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives (as Puerto Rico does today). An American High Commissioner and an American Military Advisor,[27] Douglas MacArthur headed the latter office from 1937 until the advent of World War II in 1941, holding the military rank of Field Marshal of the Philippines. After 1946, the rank of field marshal disappeared from the Philippine military.

During 1939 and 1940, after an amendment in the Commonwealth's Constitution, a bicameral Congress,[40] consisting of a Senate,[40] and of a House of Representatives,[40] was restored, replacing the National Assembly.[40]]]></description>

Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. As a unitary state, power is concentrated in the central government. Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia[63] have revamped the executive, judicial, and legislative branches.[64] The president of Indonesiais the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature. The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice president.[65] The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[66]

The highest representative body at national level is the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating the president, and formalizing broad outlines of state policy. 


Most civil disputes appear before a State Court (Pengadilan Negeri); appeals are heard before the High Court (Pengadilan Tinggi).]]></description>

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a proportional voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral: the two houses, the Chamber of Deputies (that meets in Palazzo Montecitorio) and the Senate of the Republic (that meets in Palazzo Madama), have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially President of the Council of Ministers (Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), is Italy'shead of government. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic, but must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to become in office.

While the office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems, the Italian prime minister has less authority than some of his counterparts. The prime minister is not authorized to request the dissolution of Parliament or dismiss ministers (that are exclusive prerogatives of the President of the Republic) and must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power—to execute most political activities.]]></description>

The President functions as both head of state and head of government and is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president is elected by popular vote for a single six-year term, during which he or she appoints and presides over the cabinet.[136] The bicameral Congress is composed of the Senate, serving as the upper house, with members elected to a six-year term, and the House of Representatives, serving as the lower house, with members elected to a three-year term. The senators are elected at large while the representatives are elected from both legislative districts and through sectoral representation.[136] The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court, composed of a Chief Justice as its presiding officer and fourteen associate justices, all of whom are appointed by the President from nominations submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council.[136]]]></description>

Israel operates under a parliamentary system as a democratic republic with universal suffrage.[6] A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister—usually this is the chair of the largest party. The prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet.[193][194] Israel is governed by a 120-member parliament, known as the Knesset. Membership of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties,[195] with a 2% electoral threshold, which in practice has resulted in coalition governments.

Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a no-confidence vote by the Knesset can dissolve a government earlier. The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution. In 2003, the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws.[6][196] The president of Israel is head of state, with limited and largely ceremonial duties.[193]]]></description>

The federal government of Iraq is defined under the current Constitution as a democratic, federal parliamentary Islamic republic. The federal government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as numerous independent commissions. Aside from the federal government, there are regions (made of one or more governorates), governorates, and districts within Iraq with jurisdiction over various matters as defined by law.

The National Alliance is the main Shia parliamentary bloc, and was established as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law Coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance.[77] The Iraqi National Movement is led by Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis. The party has a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of its rivals.[77] The Kurdistan List is dominated by two parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Masood Barzani and thePatriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Jalal Talabani. Both parties are secular and enjoy close ties with the West.[77]

In 2010, according to the Failed States Index, Iraq was the world's seventh most politically unstable country.[78][79] The concentration of power in the hands of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and growing pressure on the opposition have led to growing concern about the future of political rights in Iraq.[80]]]></description>

The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a President and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.]]></description>

Abdallahi's resignation allowed the election of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained that the international community had let down the opposition. Despite marginal complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.

In February 2011, the waves of the Arab Spring spread to Mauritania, where hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital.[49]]]></description>

Corruption is rife at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational,[28] and in 2012, Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt.[29] On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the National Anti-Corruption Observatory.[28]

The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year.[27] Laws are passed on a majority vote. Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president. The 1996 constitution establishes a second house of parliament, the 100-seat Senate, was established in April 2013 and is headed by a senate president who is the constitutional successor in case of untimely vacancy of the presidency .[1]The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs, fons, and lamibe to govern at the local level and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law.[30][37]]]></description>

There are currently 21 registered parties in Burundi.[9] On March 13, 1992, Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution,[39]which provided for a multi-party political process[40] and reflected multi-party competition. Six years later, on June 6, 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening National Assembly's seats and making provisions for two vice presidents. Because of the Arusha Accord, Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000.[41]

Burundi's legislative branch is a bicameral assembly, consisting of the Transitional National Assembly and the Transitional Senate. As of 2004, the Transitional National Assembly consists of 170 members, with the Front for Democracy in Burundi holding 38% of seats, and 10% of the assembly is controlled by UPRONA. Fifty-two seats are controlled by other parties. Burundi's constitution mandates representation in the Transitional National Assembly to be consistent with 60% Hutu, 40% Tutsi, and 30% female members, as well as three Batwa members.[9] Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote and serve for five-year terms.[42]]]></description>

In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms. Without first calling elections, Obote was declared the executive President.[15]

Museveni has been in power since 1986. In the mid- to late 1990s, he was lauded by the West as part of a new generation of African leaders.[20] As president, he has led Uganda in involvement in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other conflicts in the Great Lakes region. He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord's Resistance Army, which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, including child slavery and mass murder. Conflict in northern Uganda has killed thousands and displaced millions.[21]]]></description>

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be Mohamed Mediène, head of the military intelligence.[63] In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General Larbi Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.[64]

The Algerian parliament is bicameral; the lower house, the People's National Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the Council of the Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president.[67]]]></description>

As of January 2013, there was mounting public pressure on the National Congress to set up a drafting body to create a new constitution. Congress had not yet decided whether the members of the body would be elected or appointed.[91]]]></description>

A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. Full multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections were held in March 2005,[35] with a second round in May. Bozizé was declared the winner after a run-off vote.[36]
A couple of years later, the Central African Republic fell victim to one of Africa's many civil wars, rebellions and revolutions. In February 2006, there were reports of widespread violence in the northern part of the country.[37] Thousands of refugees fled their homes, caught up in the crossfire between government troops and rebel forces. More than 7,000 people fled to neighboring Chad. Those who remained in the CAR told how government troops systematically killed men and boys that they suspected of cooperation with the rebels.[38] The French military supported the Bozizé government's response to the rebels in November 2006.[16][17]

In November 2013 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that the security situation in the country remained precarious with government authority nonexistent outside of Bangui[54] andJan Eliasson, the UN deputy secretary general said that the CAR was "...descending into complete chaos.."[55] Both the president and prime minister resigned through an announcement at a regional summit in January, 2014, after which interim leader and speaker for the provisional parliament took over.[7][8]]]></description>

Malta is a republic[65] whose parliamentary system and public administration is closely modelled on the Westminster system. Malta had the second-highest voter turnout in the world (and the highest for nations without mandatory voting), based on election turnout in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995.[66] 
 
The unicameral House of Representatives, (Maltese: Kamra tad-Deputati), is elected by direct universal suffrage through single transferable vote every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the President on advice of the Prime Minister.
 
The House of Representatives is made up of 69 members of parliament. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The Constitution of Malta provides that the president appoint as prime minister the member of the House who is best able to command a (governing) majority in the House.

The President of Malta is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority.]]></description>

Sri Lanka is a democratic republic and a unitary state which is governed by a semi-presidential system, with a mixture of a presidential system and aparliamentary system.[182] It constitutes a parliamentary system governed under the constitution. Most provisions of the constitution can be amended by a two-thirds majority in parliament. However, the amendment of certain basic features such as the clauses on language, religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state require both a two-thirds majority and approval in a nation-wide referendum.]]></description>

The National Assembly is the legislature, a bicameral body having two chambers, the House of the People and the House of Elders.

The Supreme Court is led by Chief Justice Abdul Salam Azimi, a former university professor who had been a legal advisor to the president.[173] The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more technocrats than the previous one, which was dominated by fundamentalist religious figures such as Chief Justice Faisal Ahmad Shinwari who issued several controversial rulings, including seeking to place a limit on the rights of women.]]></description>

The politics of Ethiopia takes place in a framework of a federal parliamentary republic, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. On the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the Judiciary is completely independent of the executive and the legislature.[86] The current realities of this provision are questioned in a report prepared by Freedom House.[citation needed]

According to the Democracy Index published by the United Kingdom-based Economist Intelligence Unit in late 2010, Ethiopia is an "authoritarian regime", ranking 118th out of 167 countries (with the larger number being less democratic).[87] Ethiopia has dropped 12 places on the list since 2006, and the latest report attributes the drop to the regime's crackdown on opposition activities, media and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election, which the report argues has made Ethiopia a de facto one-party state.]]></description>

The Leader of the Revolution ("Supreme Leader") is responsible for delineation and supervision of the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.[119] The Supreme Leader is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations; and has sole power to declare war or peace.[119] The heads of the judiciary, state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces and six of the twelve members of the Guardian Council are appointed by the Supreme Leader.[119] The Assembly of Experts elects and dismisses the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem.[120]

 The legislature of Iran (known in English as the Islamic Consultative Assembly) is a unicameral body.[125] The Majlis of Iran comprises 290 members elected for four-year terms.[125] The Majlis drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget.

Nepal has seen rapid political changes during the last two decades. Up until 1990, Nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the King. Faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy, King Birendra, in 1990, agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the King as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of the government.                                                                            
Nepal's legislature was bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives called the Pratinidhi Sabha and a National Council called the Rastriya Sabha. The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had 60 members: ten nominated by the king, 35 elected by the House of Representatives, and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.
 
The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers (the cabinet). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal tended to be highly unstable, falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch, on the recommendation of the prime minister, according to the constitution; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991.]]></description>

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea became part of the newly independent Ukraine, which led to tensions between Russia and Ukraine.[nb 1] With the Black Sea Fleet based on the peninsula, worries of armed skirmishes were occasionally raised. Crimean Tatars began returning from exile and resettling in Crimea.
On 26 February 1992, the Verkhovniy Sovet (the Crimean parliament) renamed the ASSR the Republic of Crimea and proclaimed self-government on 5 May 1992[32][33] (which was yet to be approved by a referendum held 2 August 1992[34]) and passed the first Crimean constitution the same day.[34] On 6 May 1992 the same parliament inserted a new sentence into this constitution that declared that Crimea was part of Ukraine.[34]

On 19 May, Crimea agreed to remain part of Ukraine and annulled its proclamation of self-government but Crimean Communists forced the Ukrainian government to expand on the already extensive autonomous status of Crimea.[20]:587 In the same period, Russian president Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to divide the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and the newly formed Ukrainian Navy.[35]]]></description>

At the meeting in Brest, Belarus on 8 December, followed by the Alma Ata meeting on 21 December, the leaders of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, formally dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).[99]
 
Although the idea of an independent Ukrainian nation had previously not existed in the 20th century in the minds of international policy makers,[100] Ukraine was initially viewed as a republic with favorable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union.[101] However, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than some of the other former Soviet Republics. During the recession, Ukraine lost 60% of its GDP from 1991 to 1999,[102][103] and suffered five-digit inflation rates.[104] Dissatisfied with the economic conditions, as well as the amounts of crime and corruption in Ukraine, Ukrainians protested and organised strikes.[105]                                                               
The Ukrainian economy stabilized by the end of the 1990s. A new currency, the hryvnia, was introduced in 1996. Since 2000, the country has enjoyed steady real economic growth averaging about seven percent annually.[106][107] A new Constitution of Ukraine was adopted under second President Leonid Kuchma in 1996, which turned Ukraine into a semi-presidential republic and established a stable political system. Kuchma was, however, criticised by opponents for corruption, electoral fraud, discouraging free speech and concentrating too much power in his office.[108]                                                                                     
The Euromaidan (Ukrainian: Євромайдан, literally "Eurosquare") protests started in November 2013, when Ukrainian citizens demanded stronger integration with theEuropean Union.[117][118] The demonstrations were prompted by the refusal to sign an association agreement with the EU, which Yanukovych described as being disadvantageous to Ukraine. Over time, Euromaidan has come to describe a wave of ongoing demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine, the scope of which has evolved to include calls for the resignation of President Yanukovych and his government.

Crimean leader asks Putin for help and on March 1, Russia's parliament approved a request from President Vladimir Putin permitting the deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine, in response to the Crimean crisis.[122] Pro-Russian troops accordingly have mobilized throughout Crimea and the southeast of Ukraine]]></description>

America is no longer a democracy — never mind the democratic republic envisioned by Founding Fathers.Rather, it has taken a turn down elitist lane and become a country led by a small dominant class comprised of powerful members who exert total control over the general population — an oligarchy, said a new study jointly conducted by Princeton and Northwestern universities.

“The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence,” the study found.

The study also found: “When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose.”Read more: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/#ixzz3IHb8gzEg Follow us: @washtimes on Twitter]]></description>

As stated on its website, the CFR's mission is to be "a resource for its members, government officials, business executives, journalists, educators and students, civic and religious leaders, and other interested citizens in order to help them better understand the world and the foreign policy choices facing the United States and other countries". The CFR promotes globalization, free trade, reducing financial regulations on transnational corporations, and economic consolidation into regional blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union, and develops policy recommendations that reflect these goals.[10][11][12]

It convenes meetings at which government officials, global leaders and prominent members of the foreign policy community discuss major international issues. Its think tank, the David Rockefeller Studies Program, is composed of about fifty adjunct and full-time scholars, as well as ten in-residence recipients of year-long fellowships, who cover the major regions and significant issues shaping today's international agenda. These scholars contribute to the foreign policy debate by making recommendations to the presidential administration, testifying before Congress, serving as a resource to the diplomatic community, interacting with the media, authoring books, reports, articles, and op-eds on foreign policy issues.
