The Ashfall Fossil Beds are especially famous for fossils of mammals from the middle Miocene geologic epoch. The Ashfall Fossil Beds are stratigraphically part of the Serravallian-age[2] Ogallala Group.

The remains of Teleoceras are so numerous and concentrated that the main section of Ashfall is dubbed the "Rhino Barn". Other fossils at the "Rhino Barn" include the remains of horses and camels. Taxa discovered in the Ashfall deposits include:

- five genera of horse: Cormohipparion, Protohippus, Pseudhipparion, Neohipparion and Pliohippus
- three genera of camelids: Procamelus, Aepycamelus and Protolabis
- three genera of canids: Leptocyon, Cynarctus and Aelurodon
- one genus of rhinoceros: Teleoceras
- one genus of saber-toothed deer: Longirostromeryx
- three bird species: crowned crane (Balearica exigua), rail and secretary bird (Apatosagittarus)
- two species of turtle: Hesperotestudo and pond turtle]]></description>

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page-Ladson_prehistory_site#Late_Pleistocene_animals_and_Paleoindians)

The lowest strata in Page-Ladson is late Pleistocene. In includes mastodon, mammoth, horse and ground sloth, palaeolama bones and "straw mats" of chopped vegetation (leaves, bark and wood) of relatively uniform length. The length of the chopped vegetation is consistent with the spacing between cusps on mastodon teeth, and the "straw mats" have been interpreted as equivalent to the layers of trampledelephant dung found around water holes in Africa. Elephant steroids have been identified in the "digesta" deposits at Page-Ladson and Latvis-Simpson (a 32,000-year-old mastodon site farther south in the Aucilla). Some of the bones from this level show apparent human-made cut marks, particularly a complete mastodon tusk. Ivory spear points (often called "foreshafts") are found more frequently in the Aucilla River than everywhere else in North America combined. Samples from the "straw mat" level have yielded radiocarbon dates from 13,130 +/- 200 to 11,770 +/- 90 years Before Present. The "straw mat" level is covered by a layer of mud that did not contain any bones of extinct animals.[11]]]></description>

Bone Cabin Quarry lies approximately fifteen miles north of Laramie, Wyomingnear historic Como Bluff. During the summer of 1897 Walter W. Granger, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History, came upon a hillside littered with Jurassic period dinosaur bone fragments. Nearby was a sheepherder's cabin built entirely out of fossil bones, hence the name "Bone Cabin Quarry." After Granger's discovery in late August 1897, the quarry was kept secret until the summer of 1898, when the manpower could be amassed to undertake a full-scale excavation. Bone Cabin Quarry was excavated from 1898 until 1905, when the productivity of specimens thinned. Some of the dinosaurs found at the Bone Cabin Quarry include Stegosaurus, Allosaurus and Apatosaurus.]]></description>

The Calvert Formation is notable for its plentiful fossil shark teeth. Especially popular among "rockhounds" are those from giants such as Carcharocles and the famous Megalodon (which is often included in Carcharocles).

The ancestral baleen whale Eobalaenoptera harrisoni and the merganser Mergus miscellus were described from the Virginian part of the formation. From the uppermost layer, deposited 15-14 Ma, they represent the oldest known member of their family and genus, respectively. Some remains of a prehistoric loon (Gavia) from the lowermost parts of the Calvert Formation, dating back nearly 18 Ma, are the oldest records of that genus from North America, and among of the oldest worldwide.]]></description>

A dyrosaurid crocodylomorph called Cerrejonisuchus improcerus was described in 2010 from the Cerrejón Formation in the same layer as Titanoboa. It was a small dyrosaurid, and had the shortest snout length relative to its skull length of any dyrosaurid.]]></description>

The Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, located in The San Rafael Swell, near Cleveland, Utah, contains the densest concentration of Jurassic dinosaur fossils ever found. Well over 15,000 bones have been excavated from this Jurassic "predator trap" and there are many thousands more awaiting excavation and study. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in October 1965.[1]]]></description>

The formation is named for the small town of Chazy, New York, where the reef was noted by James Hall in Palaeontology of New York (vol. I, 1847) and the fossils first studied by the Canadian paleontologist Elkanah Billings (1858, 1859).[2] The reef extends from Tennessee to Quebec[3] andNewfoundland, but its most easily studied outcropping is at Goodsell Ridge, Isle La Motte, the northernmost island in Lake Champlain; there, gentle uplift has tilted the sediments: the bedding planes now dip slightly to the north, revealing sequences of horizons in exposed rock. The black limestone of Isle La Motte takes a polish, revealing the white "bird's-eye"[4] markings of embedded fossil shells, notably the spirals formed by sliced gastropodshells. Rock of the Chazy Formation was quarried from the nineteenth century at the Fisk Quarry, Isle La Motte, the oldest quarry in Vermont.[5]]]></description>

Various plant and animal fossils have been found in the Chuckanut Formation. A fossil turtle shell was recovered from the formation at Clark Point in 1960. The specimen was held in the private collection of the finders until 1981 when it was examined at Western Washington University and identified as an indeterminate member of the Testudinoidea superfamily. Reexamination of the fossil in 2000 showed specimen to belong to the Trionychidaefamily of soft shelled turtles.[13]
Eocene fossil trackways are found in the Chuckanut Formation, composed of both birds[14] and animals, including mammals and some turtle tracks.[15] It is thought that the Chuckanut Formation shoreline was of riverine environments combined with a large scale "bedding plane" of material deposition. Four deposition or track sites are known.[16]]]></description>

Nineteenth century paleontologists discovered many well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs, as well as mammals, turtles, crocodilians, and fish from the Morrison Formation. Because of this, Como Bluff is considered to be one of the major sites for the early discovery of dinosaur remains. Among the species discovered is the only known specimen ofCoelurus. Significant discoveries were made in 22 different areas scattered along the entire length of the ridge. It is included on the National Register of Historic Places as well as the National Natural Landmark list.]]></description>

The Decorah lies above the Platteville Limestone and below the Galena Limestone in the sedimentary sequence that formed from the shallow sea that covered central North America duringOrdovician Time. 
 
Where it crops out in the Upper Midwest, especially in the Twin Cities, the Decorah is a popular place for amateur fossil collecting. It contains trilobites, brachiopods, horn corals, gastropods,crinoids, and large numbers of bryozoans.[1] Cephalopods may also be found in the lower layers of the Decorah Shale.]]></description>

In 1877, some of the best-known dinosaurs were found here, including Apatosaurus,Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and Allosaurus. In 1973, the area was recognized for its uniqueness as well as its historical and scientific significance when it was designated the Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. In 1989, the Friends of Dinosaur Ridge formed to address increasing concerns regarding the preservation of the site and to offer educational programs on the area's resources.]]></description>

Dinosaur Provincial Park preserves an extraordinarily diverse group of freshwater vertebrates. Fish include sharks, rays (such as the durophage Myledaphus), paddlefish, bowfins, gars, andteleosts. Amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and the extinct albanerpetontids. Reptiles include lizards (such as the large monitor Paleosaniwa), a wide range of turtles, crocodilians, and the fish-eating Champsosaurus. Mammal fossils from the park are relatively rare and consist of isolated teeth, fragmentary jaws with teeth, and tooth fragments from mouse-sized and shrew-sized animals. They include representatives of placental, marsupial, andmultituberculate mammals.[2]
 
Plant fossils from the park and surrounding area include fern fronds; foliage and wood of taxodiaceous and cupressaceous conifers; and leaves of Ginkgo, Cercidiphyllum, Platanus, aPistia-like aquatic plant, and others.[3] A rich assemblage of fossil pollen and spores has also been described.[4]]]></description>

Dinosaur State Park is one of the largest dinosaur track sites in North America. The tracks are from the early Jurassic period and were made over 200 million years ago by a carnivorous dinosaur similar to Dilophosaurus. At present, 500 tracks are enclosed within a 55,000-square-foot (5,100 m2) geodesic dome; the remaining 1,500 are buried for preservation. The park's in-site tracks are Eubrontes, named by Edward Hitchcock, pioneering student of fossilized tracks and one of America's first geologists. The tracks range from 10 to 16 inches (410 mm) in length and are spaced 3.5 to 4.5 feet (1.4 m) apart. The exhibit center also includes rock slabs with other Connecticut Valley fossil tracks, including large four-toed Otozoum tracks with clearly visible skin impressions.[4]]]></description>

As the algae fell to the bottom of the lake, any plants or animals that had recently died were preserved by the algal mats.

Stanley A. Tyler examined the area in 1953, and noted the red-colored stromatolites. He also sampled a jet-black chert layer which, when observedpetrographically, revealed some lifelike small spheres, rods and filaments less than 10 micrometres in size. Elso Barghoorn, a paleobotanist at Harvard, subsequently looked at these same samples. Barghoorn concluded that "they were indeed structurally preserved unicellular organisms."[2] In 1965, the two scientists published their finding, and named a variety of the Gunflint flora.[3] This created an academic "stampede" to explore Precambrian microfossils from similar Proterozoic environments.]]></description>

The formation has produced impressive assemblages of invertebrates, plants, mammals, fish, reptiles (including the lizard Obamadon), and amphibians. Notable dinosaur finds include Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. The most complete Hadrosaurid dinosaur ever found was retrieved in 2000 from the Hell Creek Formation and widely publicised in a National Geographic documentary aired in December 2007. A few bird, mammal, and pterosaur fossils have also been found. Teeth ofsharks and rays are sometimes found in the riverine Hell Creek Formation, suggesting that some of these taxa were then, as now, tolerant of fresh water.]]></description>

By the conclusion of the research program, the scientists mapped the bonebeds and excavated the bonebed cataloged as H97-04.[9] They concluded that the Hilda bonebeds formed simultaneously when a herd consisting of thousands of Centrosaurus apertus drowned in a flood.[9] The researchers further speculated that some of the 17 Centrosaurus bonebeds of Dinosaur Provincial Park likely formed simultaneously in a manner analogous to the formation of the Hilda bonebeds, which the researchers estimated to be spread over 2.3 km.[9] The researchers only collected fossils and taphonomic data from the bonebed H97-04, although all the others were also examined to check the quality and number of preserved bones.[10] The research at Hilda was so complex that over ten years passed from the start of the project until David A. Eberth, Donald B. Brinkman, and Vaia Barkas published a formal description in the scientific literature.[11]]]></description>

The Hornerstown Formation is a Paleogene or latest Mesozoic geologic formation.[1] The age of these deposits have been controversial. While most fossils are of animals types known from the earliest Cenozoic era, several fossils of otherwise exclusively Cretaceous age have been found. These include remains of the shark Squalicorax, the teleost fish Enchodus, several species of ammonite, and marine lizards referred to the genusMosasaurus. Some of these remains show signs of severe abrasion and erosion, however, implying that they are probably re-worked from older deposits. Most of these fossils are restricted to the lowest point in the formation, one rich in fossils and known as the Main Fossiliferous Layer, or MFL. Other explanations for the out-of-place fossils in the MFL is that they represent a time-averaged assemblage that built up and remained unburied during a time of low sediment deposition, or that they were stirred up from deeper in the sediment and deposited together during a tsunami.[2]]></description>

The Ischigualasto Formation contains Late Triassic (Carnian) deposits (231.4 -225.9 million years before the present[4]), with some of the oldest known dinosaur remains, which are the world's first with regards to quality, number and importance. It is the only place in the world where nearly all of the Triassic is represented in an undisturbed sequence of rock deposits. This allows for the study of the transition between dinosaurs and ancient mammals; research is ongoing.
 
Rhynchosaurs and cynodonts (especially rhynchosaur Hyperodapedon and cynodont Exaeretodon[4]) are by far the predominant findings among the tetrapod fossils in the park. Dinosaur specimens comprise only 6% of the total tetrapod sample;[5] subsequent discoveries increased this number to approximately 11% of all findings.[4] Carnivorous dinosaurs are the most common terrestrial carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation, with herrerasaurids comprising 72% of all recovered terrestrial carnivores.]]></description>

In 1852 Lyell and Dawson made a celebrated discovery of tetrapod fossils entombed within an upright tree at Coal Mine Point. Subsequent investigations by Dawson led to the discovery of one of the most important fossils in the history of science, Hylonomus lyelli, which remains the earliest known sauropsid (reptile) in the history of life, but not oldest known amniote, the group that includes all vertebrates that can reproduce out of water.[9] In 2002, Hylonomus lyelli was named the provincial fossil of Nova Scotia. Another vital early tetrapod fossil has been found here, the earliest synapsid, Protoclepsydrops, which is actually earlier thanHylonomus.[10]p39]]></description>

The Judith River Formation is a fossil-bearing geologic formation in Montana, and is part of the Judith River Group. It dates to the upper Cretaceous, between 80 and 75 million years ago, corresponding to the "Judithian" land vertebrate age. It was laid down during the same time period as portions of the Two Medicine Formation of Montana[1] and the Oldman Formation of Alberta.[5] It is an historically important formation, explored by early American paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope, who named several dinosaurs from scrappy remains found here on his 1876 expedition (such as Monoclonius). Modern work has found nearly complete skeletons of the hadrosaurid Brachylophosaurus.

Krukowski Quarry is a sandstone quarry near Mosinee, Wisconsin. In the late Cambrian period (510 m.y.a), this area was a beach and shoreline, and the quarry is well known for abundant fossil impressions of Climactichnites, Protichnites, and beached jellyfish, Scyphozoan Medusae. Pre-Devonianevidence of this jellyfish is exceedingly rare; this location and one in New Brunswick hold the only known fossils. The fossilized tracks ofClimactichnites and Protichnites are also amongst the best preserved examples in the world. No fossilized remains of the either animal exist, making them enigmatic species. The quality and quantity of these fossil tracks in the quarry are extremely valuable to paleontologists.]]></description>

Asphaltum or tar (brea in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the bones of animals that were trapped in the tar were preserved. The George C.

At least tens of thousands of Late Cretaceous vertebrate remains have been recovered from the Lance Formation. Fossils ranging from microscopic elements to extensive bonebeds, with nearly complete, sometimes articulated dinosaur skeletons, have been found. Most other animals known from the formation are freshwater animals, and some are exclusively freshwater forms (for instance, frogs and salamanders). However, marine fossils are also found in the formation, suggesting that the sea was nearby. The bird fauna is mainly composed of orders still existing today.]]></description>

Trilobites are the primary fossil remains found in the rocks of the Manuels River. These prehistoric animals lived on the seabed and left trails as they crawled around in search of food. Trilobites resemble sow bugs (commonly known as 'carpenters') or crabs and were first discovered along the river in 1874 by T.C. Weston of the Geological Survey of Canada. Complete specimens are rare, however, some have been found measuring as long as 30 cm. Many of the fossil remains are fragments of their shells discarded in a manner similar to today's lobsters.
Removing fossil specimens and rock samples is prohibited, but the Society encourages observation and provides educational tours of these wonders from our prehistoric past.]]></description>

(AP)—For the first time in three decades, paleontologists are about to revisit one of North America's most remarkable troves of ancient fossils: The bones of tens of thousands of animals piled at the bottom of a sinkhole-type cave.
 
Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming is 85 feet (25 meters) deep and almost impossible to see until you're standing right next to it. Over tens of thousands of years, many, many animals—including now-extinct mammoths, short-faced bears, American lions and American cheetahs—shared the misfortune of not noticing the 15-foot-wide (4 meters) opening until they were plunging to their deaths.                                                                          
Now, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is preparing to reopen a metal grate over the opening to offer scientists what may be their best look yet at the variety of critters that roamed the foothills of the Bighorn Mountains during the planet's last glacial period around 25,000 years ago.]]></description>

The Oldman Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (Campanian stage) age that underlies much of southernAlberta, Canada. It consists primarily of sandstones that were deposited in fluvial channel and floodplain environments. It was named for exposures along the Oldman River between its confluence with the St. Mary River and the city ofLethbridge, and it is known primarily for its dinosaur remains and other fossils.[3]

The Nature Center has a display of fossils found in the area. They also rent screens and trowels for use while looking for fossils. The fossils in the exposed Navesink Formation are in the stream bed and are easily accessible from the parking lot along Middletown road. There is a display sign with pictures of the fossils likely to be found. The Conservancy asks that visitors collect from the stream bed only and not to dig into the banks which only hastens erosion. They also ask that visitors collect conservatively and that anything unusual be given to the Nature Center.[3][5]
 
Common fossils include Pyncnodonte mutabilis, Pyncnodonte convexa, Exogyra cancellata, Exogyra costata, Ostrea mesenterica,Agerostrea, Belemnitella americana and shark teeth. These are mostly extinct version of oysters and clams.]]></description>

Thetracks are believed to have been made during the Middle Jurassic Period, 160-180 million years b.p., on what was then a shore of the Sundance Sea. Theropod tracks are thought to be among those discovered, but evidence suggests that the tracks were made by a large, diverse group of dinosaurs.]]></description>

The Ripley Formation is a geological formation in North America found in the U.S. states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri,[1] andTennessee. The lithology is quite consistent throughout the layer. It consists mainly of glauconitic sandstone. It was formed by sediments deposited during the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. It is a unit of the Selma Group and consists of the Cusseta Sand Member, McNairy Sand Member and an unnamed lower member.[2] It has not been extensively studied by vertebrate paleontologists, due to a lack of accessible exposures. Crocodile, dinosaur, and mosasaur fossil remains have been recovered from the Ripley Formation.[2]]]></description>

Some 25 species of fossil fishes are often found with stomach contents preserved, enabling paleontologists to study predator-prey relationships in this ecosystem. There are also fine examples of pterosaurs, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates (particularly insects), and plants. Even dinosaurs are represented: a new maniraptor was described in 1996. The unusual taphonomy of the site resulted in limestone accretions that formed nodules around dead organisms, preserving even soft parts of their anatomy. In preservation, the nodules are etched away with acid, and the fossils often prepared by the transfer technique.[1]

The Snowmastodon site, also known as the Snowmass Village fossil site or the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site, is a fossil excavation nearSnowmass Village, Colorado. It was discovered on October 14, 2010, when construction workers building a reservoir dam to supply water to Snowmass Village uncovered fossil bones that turned out to belong to a young female mammoth. Official fossil excavations, organized by the Denver Museum of Nature and Science under the nickname "Snowmastodon Project," began on November 2, 2010. They ended, as agreed, on July 1, 2011, so that construction work could resume. During this short period, the project unearthed 4,826 bones from 26 different Ice Agevertebrates, including mammoths, mastodons, bisons, camels, a Pleistocene horse, and the first ground sloth ever found in Colorado.
The site, once the shores of a small glacial lake, dates from the Illinoian age of the Pleistocene epoch, around 150,000 to 130,000 years ago.]]></description>

Egg Mountain was discovered in 1977 by Marion Brandvold, owner of the Trex Agate Rock Shop in Bynum, Montana, who discovered the bones of juvenile dinosaurs at this site. It is a colonial nesting site on the Willow Creek Anticline in the Two Medicine Formation that is famous for its fossil eggs ofMaiasaura, which demonstrated for the first time that at least some dinosaurs cared for their young. The eggs were arranged in dug-out earthen nests, each nest about a parent's body length from the next, and baby dinosaurs were also found with skeletons too cartilaginous for them to walk - similar to those of altricial (helpless) baby birds. The parent(s) must then have brought food to the young, and there is plant matter in the nests that may be evidence of either this or for incubation of the eggs. Maiasaura also grew extremely fast, at rates comparable to modern birds. Skeletons of Orodromeusand skeletons and eggs of Troodon were also found at Egg Mountain.]]></description>

Urumaco is a town in the state of Falcón in Venezuela. It is of world importance for its fossils. Thearid climate of the region means that the fossils are not hidden by vegetation. They were first made known to science by geologists who came across them while looking for oil (which is abundant in some parts of Venezuela). The paleontological wealth of Urumaco makes it the most fossil-rich zone of northern South America.
 
Stupendemys geographicus, the largest turtle ever to have existed was found here in the 1970s by researchers from Harvard University. More recently publicity has been attracted by discoveries of the giant rodent Phoberomys pattersoni from the Miocene epoch.[1]]]></description>

These animals lived some 13.8 to 12million years ago in the Laventan age, which was named after La Venta. At that time, theclimate of the region was wetter than today and there was much forest of trees similar (and probably related) to the sapino (Goupia glabra) of our time.]]></description>

Many mammals are found at the site. All are small compared to modern mammals, the largest being sheep-sized. Preserved mammals include a squirrel-like primitive primate and Ptilodus; an arboreal multituberculate. The largest mammal at the site is the condylarth herbivore Phenacodus. An additional mammal fossil is Protictis, a weasel sized member of Viverridae that may have hunted on the forest floor.  

Reptiles are the dominant animal type preserved at Wannagan. The largest animal (~4 meters [13 ft] in length) found at the site is the eusuchian crocodilian Borealosuchus formidabilis(formerly known as Leidyosuchus formidabilis). B. formidabilis is also thought to be the apex predator of the fauna. The second largest reptile is the champsosaur Champsosaurus gigas. C. gigas is unusual among Paleocene reptiles in that it is larger than its known Mesozoic ancestors; 3 meters (10 ft) in length versus 1.5 meters (4.5 ft) for the largest Cretaceouschampsosaurs. Reptiles as a whole decreased in size after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Other reptiles include soft-shelled turtles, varanid lizards, a small alligatorid calledWannaganosuchus, palaeophid snakes, and the snapping turtle-like Protochelydra zangerli.]]></description>

Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific genus.[2]
 
Well-preserved dinosaur footprints – possibly of Hadrosauridae – have been found in this formation, as were fossil eggs, stromatolites and the Mesozoic palynomorph Aquilapollenites. [1]]]></description>

It's not exactly small at 30 feet long (9 meters), but you might want to call this newly identified dinosaur the littlest giant.

Scientists in Argentina on Wednesday announced the discovery of the fossilized remains of a unique member of the famous long-necked, plant-munching dinosaurs known as sauropods, the largest land creatures in Earth's history.

Leinkupal lived in a semiarid environment south of a large desert, the researchers said. Its incomplete remains were found in Patagonia - a region renowned for its dinosaur finds - in 2010 and 2012 in Argentina's Neuquen province, they added.]]></description>

Paleontologists unearthed the fossilized HAVE JUST bones of a gigantic dinosaur that's never been seen before. They believe it's an Entirely new species-and based on the size of its bones, it's way bigger than what we thought was the biggest dinosaur ever. Meet the new Among number one earthly creatures.

The bones first discovered in the desert near the Arrow, roughly 140 miles from Trelew, Patagonia, by a farmer locally. Paleontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol, Have since uncovered some 150 bones Belonging to single seven skeletons. ]]></description>

			<name>A Gigantic, Exceptionally Complete Titanosaurian Sauropod Dinosaur from Southern Patagonia, Argentina</name>
			<ExtendedData>

			<description><![CDATA[nature.com (http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140904/srep06196/full/srep06196.html)

Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaurs were the most diverse and abundant large-bodied herbivores in the southern continents during the final 30 million years of the Mesozoic Era. Several titanosaur species are regarded as the most massive land-living animals yet discovered; nevertheless, nearly all of these giant titanosaurs are known only from very incomplete fossils, hindering a detailed understanding of their anatomy. Here we describe a new and gigantic titanosaur, Dreadnoughtus schrani, from Upper Cretaceous sediments in southern Patagonia, Argentina. Represented by approximately 70% of the postcranial skeleton, plus craniodental remains, Dreadnoughtus is the most complete giant titanosaur yet discovered, and provides new insight into the morphology and evolutionary history of these colossal animals. Furthermore, despite its estimated mass of about 59.3 metric tons, the bone histology of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen reveals that this individual was still growing at the time of death.]]></description>
