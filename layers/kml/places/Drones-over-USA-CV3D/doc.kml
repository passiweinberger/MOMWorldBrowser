						<Data name="Summary of Authorized Operations">
							<value>The National Energy Technology National Laboratory (NETL) intends to conduct a series of test flights for the purpose of developing and testing lightweight sensors for monitoring air emissions.  The equipment is the Guided Systems Technologies Inc. SiCX-12, gasoline engine powered helicopter, 76 in. main rotor diameter, 33.0 lbs maximum takeoff weight.  The proposed test flights will be conducted in Class G Airspace and within the controlled access boundaries of the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC).  RMOTC is a Government-owned oilfield, operated by the US Department of Energy located about 30 nm northeast of the Casper Natrona Airport (KCPR) in Wyoming.  The nearest airport is Iberlin Ranch (WY18) located 17 nm northwest of RMOTC.  These VFR, daylight only operations will launch and recover within the sparsely populated RMOTC boundaries.  We estimate no more than 3 missions in a given day of 1 hour or less during the testing period that has yet to be determined.  There is 2.0 hours of fuel on board.  Except for the purpose of takeoff and landing, missions will be flown at or below 5500 ft MSL and 400 ft AGL and visual-line-of-sight.   This UAS helicopter uses the Cloud Cap Technology Piccolo II autopilot system capable of full autonomous flight or manual control.  Operations will be conducted in accordance with Part 61, 91 and other regulations deemed applicable by the Administrator.</value>

						</Data>
						<Data name="Summary of Authorized Operations">
							<value>Operation of the NexSTAR UA by RECUV is compliant with AFS-400 UAS Policy 05-01 in that flight operations will be conducted in Class ``G&apos;&apos; airspace under VFR meteorological conditions, at or below 400 feet AGL, during daylight hours.  Flights will occur approximately once a week with two to three 30 minute flights per deployment.  At no time will the UA be allowed to be any farther than 1-nautical mile horizontally, or than 400&apos; vertically from a ground based observer trained in FAR Part 91.  Observers will follow FAR Part 91.113 Right-of-Way Rules for providing traffic and collision avoidance. Since the NexSTAR UA is significantly more maneuverable than any manned category of aircraft, the NexSTAR UA will always give way to all manned aircraft. Communication between the observer and the PIC is described in the Visual Surveillance/Detection Capability section.

Flights will occur over the U.S. Department of Commerce&apos;s Table Mountain Field Site and Radio Quiet Zone, located north of Boulder, Colorado. The entire operation of the UAS from launch through landing will be restricted to the boundary of Table Mountain.  Because of this, the UA will always be within a 2-nautical mile range of the GCS, which is well within the expected 20 mile communication range of the Piccolo system.  Essential features of the Table Mountain flying site includes flat terrain with no perimeter obstructions for LOS see-and-avoid, gated perimeter with restricted access to limited personnel, and has radio quiet zone protection by both State and Federal laws from strong external RF signals. An additional benefit of this site, though it is not restricted airspace, is that there is a notice published on navigational charts (see supplied Map Attachment) stating: 

PILOTS ARE REQUESTED TO AVOID LANDING OR HOVERING AT TABLE MOUNTAIN FIELD SITE

further reducing the potential of any traffic conflicts by encouraging other aircraft traffic to remain above 500&apos; AGL over this site.</value>

US Dept of Interior noted in a letter in response to questions regarding bird disturbance on the University of Florida's UAS COA application: the project "combines aeronautical engineers, remote sensing specialists, photogrammetrists, statisticians and wildlife biologists specifically to address assessment of wildlife populations and habitats."

The NOVA sUAS is a 13 lb fixed-wing UAV with a 9 ft wingspan. Built with hybrid composite construction, the rugged and waterproof aircraft is hand-launched and amphibiously landable.  The NOVA is driven by a brushless electric drive unit powered with rechargeable lithium-polymer batteries that yield a duration of 1.5hrs.</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/university-florida" target="_blank">https://www.eff.org/document/university-florida</a></p>

US Dept of Interior noted in a letter in response to questions regarding bird disturbance on the University of Florida&apos;s UAS COA application: the project &quot;combines aeronautical engineers, remote sensing specialists, photogrammetrists, statisticians and wildlife biologists specifically to address assessment of wildlife populations and habitats.&quot;

The NOVA sUAS is a 13 lb fixed-wing UAV with a 9 ft wingspan. Built with hybrid composite construction, the rugged and waterproof aircraft is hand-launched and amphibiously landable.  The NOVA is driven by a brushless electric drive unit powered with rechargeable lithium-polymer batteries that yield a duration of 1.5hrs.</value>

<b>Comments:</b> APD has withheld information on whether they are using "light out," VFR, IFR, Day or Night operations, as well as info on how the drone flies (speed, turn rate, descent rate, etc) (see "COA 2011.xls," "AIRCRAFT_SYSTEM.pdf"(some of this is visible if you copy the text from the pdf and pasteit into a new document). APD has also tried to withhold information on where it flies the drone (see "COA_STATUS_DOCUMENT2.pdf" at p.10) but the boxes are removable.

"The aircraft is an electric helicopter equipped with a sophisticated autopilot and video sensors." According to mfr, drone can be outfitted with turret mounted cameras or can carry "commercial off-the-shelf cameras" like the Sony Handi-Cam and the Nikon D5000 DSLR. The drone can also be outfitted with "FLIR and night vision, [and] SAR and LIDAR packages available." "http://www.leptron.com/corporate/products/avenger /specs.php. FLIR is an infrared/ thermal imaging technology. SAR is a type of radar.

<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> The Gadsen Police Department is involved in multi-agency efforts for narcotics enforcement (Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit) and tactical operations (Joint Special Operations Group).  Both entities operate on a county-wide basis.  In response to the need for situational awareness and intelligence, the DEU and JSOG have established an unmanned aircraft system program. The UAS will not be used for routine patrol but only in response to a specific dedicated law enforcement mission in a defined area.

Both entities operate on a county-wide basis.  In response to the need for situational awareness and intelligence, the DEU and JSOG have established an unmanned aircraft system program. The UAS will not be used for routine patrol but only in response to a specific dedicated law enforcement mission in a defined area. DEU personnel will use the UAS for covert surveillance of drug transactions and develop video evidence of such activities.  JSOG personnel will use the UAS for pre-operational planning and surveillance, maintaining operational security, and obtaining evidentiary video.

<b>Type of Drone:</b> Honeywell Micro Air Vehicle</p><p><b>Status:</b> Active</p><p>
<b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Miami-Dade County, FL</p><p>
<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> To test and train with the use of Honeywell Micro Air Vehicle in supporting police tactical teams in the urban Miami-Dade County area. Operation of a Honeywell MAV in class G airspace at or below 400 feet AGL.  The operation will launch, operate and recover within the fenced in boundries of an abandoned group of buildings located in the Everglades. The flights will occur in day VFR conditions for the purpose of training and testing the MAV to develop safety and operations procedures.

COA for 2011-ESA-4: Due to the nature of its intended use the Miami-Dade Police Department is requesting the ability to utilize the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) up to and including 300' AGL in .  This would enable the MAV to show an aerial view of most residences from overhead.  It would enable the on scene tactical commander to view all four sides of a structure in real time and allow him to make decisions based on this information.  This would increase his situational awareness and safety to officers while reducing radio transmissions.  This altitude would also avoid any potential conflicts by providing a level of separation between the MAV and other Air Traffic.

The pilot and/or Observer are to maintain line of sight contact and visual observation of the MAV while in flight and remain within 2000 feet laterally of the MAV.  The request for this increased distance is that the MAV Program was intended in situations where a subject was either known or suspected to be in possession of a long gun where utilization of traditional aviation assets would pose an increased risk to the aircrew and aircraft.  This distance is easily achievable by a skilled gunman with a rifle and/or a scope but would give the aircrew additional flexibility in site selection.  In urban areas this additional distance would not be necessary but with some of the more rural areas of MDC the added distance would provide more options for the MAV crew.  

The MAV will not be intentionally flown over non-hostile personnel or vehicles, nor used in vehicle pursuits or operated from a moving vehicle and/or aircraft.</p><p>

1) Crash site related to interstate transport of hazardous materials
2) Crash site related to railroad transport of hazardous materials
3) Search &amp; Rescue operations
4) Tactical support of Law Enforcement operations

 The aircraft will be used for flight training, operational testing and payload testing.  

The operation will launch, remain within, and recover from City of Seattle controlled and owned property.  Duration of each flight will be approximately 15 minutes, will not exceed a ceiling of 400 feet AGL, and the same location will be used throughout the year long COA for training purposes.  The city property mentioned above provides an ideal controlled atmosphere for training.  The training ground contains hilly terrain, non-occupied vehicles, and buildings. The COA approved area will aid in training without risk to people, property or wildlife.</value>

<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> This is a renewal of COA 2010-CSA-11 due to expire September 20, 2011. Minor changes include; moved lost link orbit(VOLVO)to a different location within R-5104A, changed names of lost link/holding areas, and added Local Operating Procedures reference 27 SOG/OI 11-201, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Flying Operations dated May 11, 2011.  This COA provides a corridor to get the MQ-1 Predator from Cannon AFB Class D airspace to R-5104A during day-light hours using several ground observers. This is the ONLY means of getting the RPA to training airspace. Training is of vital importance to ensure Air Force Special Operations MQ-1 Predator pilots are proficient and capable of integrating with other Special Operating Forces so they can deploy rapidly anywhere in the world. RPA are invaluable DoD assets in the Global War on terrorism and is of utmost importance to the National Security. 

 Anticipated use of this corridor is approximately twice per day (Monday-Friday).  Actual time in the corridor for each use is approximately 20 minutes. . . . Every effort will be made to ensure the local flying community in and around Cannon AFB is aware of UAS activities.

<b>Type of Drone:</b> MQ-9 Reaper</p><p><b>Status:</b> Active</p><p>
<b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Curry, NM</p><p>
<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> This is a new COA for the MQ-9, however, it uses the same airspace and procedures in 2011-CSA-54 (Cannon MQ-1 COA) except altitude requested is 4000' AGL vs. the 3000' AGL requested in the MQ-1 COA. This COA provides a corridor to get the MQ-9 Predator from Cannon AFB Class D airspace to R-5104A during day-light hours using several ground observers. This is the ONLY means of getting the RPA to training airspace. Training is of vital importance to ensure Air Force Special Operations MQ-9 Reaper pilots are proficient and capable of integrating with other Special Operating Forces so they can deploy rapidly anywhere in the world. RPA are invaluable DoD assets in the Global War on terrorism and is of utmost importance to the National Security.

Anticipated use of this corridor is approximately twice per day (Monday-Friday).  Actual time in the corridor for each use is approximately 20 minutes. Altitude of the corridor is 4000' AGL (8300' MSL). Operations within the corridor will be conducted during VMC and during daylight hours. . . . In-addition; programs that have proven successful in educating the local flying community such as the Cannon Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) and the Pilot Controller Liaison Programs will continue and will emphasis the proposed RPA activities. The corridor operations are within the Cannon AFB RAPCON airspace and will be controlled by USAF Air Traffic Controllers.</p><p>
<b>Effective Dates:</b> 10/15/2011-10/14/2012</p><p>
<b>Comments:</b> Air Force seems worried about potential for mid-air collisions and other problems in this location. It sounds like the authorized flight corridor is in an area where there are private or civil manned aircraft flights. (see "COA_SPECIAL_CIRCUM_DOC4.pdf") This document notes that "8 incidents [involving Predators] occurred over a period of 79,177 flying hours. Further analysis of these incidents reveals that all occurred in congested airspace. 4 HATRs were attributed to task saturation of air traffic controllers, 2 were attributed to poor radio coverage, and 2 were attributed to UAS pilot error. Of the two pilot errors, both occurred during inclement weather that would have precluded operations in a non-combat environment." (see p. 8) This document also has a risk assessment table on p. 8.

<b>Comments:</b> "The Puma-AE Air Vehicle can be launched and recovered in minutes without special equipment on unprepared terrain, including water, mud, snow, and dirt. The system employs a self-stabilizing Air Vehicle configuration with stability augmentation avionics, and provides ease of control and steady video imagery. Air and ground components are lightweight and easily configured for transport. The Puma-AE Air Vehicle is battery-powered and has low visual, acoustic, and thermal signatures. The Puma-AE Air Vehicle flies for 120 minutes on rechargeable Lithium Ion (Li-ion) battery pack." (see "TSO.pdf")

<b>Comments:</b> Stennis Space Center (SSC) was established in the 1960s, the United States Government purchased approximately 13,800 acres in fee simple (often referred to as the “Fee Area” in the shape of roughly a five mile square) to establish a facility for testing the large Saturn V launch vehicle stages and engines used for the Apollo program. The Government also purchased a perpetual restrictive easement in approximately 125,000 acres of land, commonly referred to as the “buffer zone,” surrounding the test facility and extending about six miles in all directions.

Although most of the buffer zone is privately owned, the area is uninhabited because the Government’s easement prohibits habitable structures, including mobile homes, campers, trailers or other enclosed structures. However, the easement does not prohibit landowners from using lands within the buffer zone for activities that do not violate the easement restriction, such as timber production, grazing, haying, agriculture, fishing ponds, mineral extraction, and recreational activities.

A consent agreement between NASA and the Pearl River Basin Development District allows temporary camping for the public benefit at McLeod Water Park. The agreement permits transient camping at the Park for a period not to exceed 14 consecutive days (see "COA_SPECIAL_CIRCUM_DOC.pdf")</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011" target="_blank">https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011</a></p>

<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> The test is urgent and must meet deadlines for the JUON (Joint Urgent Operation Need) that is being conducting. Testing
requires the aircraft be established in an orbit for extended periods focusing on a ground target. The test is not harmful to the environment or persons on the ground and does not require ordnance to be launched from the
aircraft.

The purpose of this operation is to test equipment that will enhance military operations and security. No ordnance will be involved in this test. The aircraft will be on station for varying lengths of time depending on test progress and requirements. The duration of the test is approximately 6 months, however in anticipation of possible unforeseen delays we are requesting the COA be approved for 12 months.</p><p>

<b>Type of Drone:</b> University Built (One-Third Scale Piper Cub) UAS</p><p><b>Status:</b> Expired</p><p>
<b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Aurora, NY</p><p>
<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> The purpose of the proposed UAV flights in this COA is to develop and use experimentally, a system to vertically profile the atmosphere from 300 ft agl to 3000 ft agl.  The UAV payload will be instrumentation to continuously measure temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction as the UAV spirals vertically from 300 ft agl to 3000 ft agl and back down to 300 ft agl.  The UAV will maintain a GPS controlled circle with a 1500 ft diameter utilizing a Micropilot 1028 autopilot.  The climb rate will be 150 ft/min and the duration of the flight will be approximately 40 min.

This system will replace the release of helium filled balloons with radio equipped weather packages and the use of tethered blimps utilized to lift weather instrumentation into the lower atmosphere.  

An UAV mounted system is superior because the helium filled free flying balloons rise through the lower 3000 ft of the atmosphere too quickly for accurate weather data.  The tethered blimps have a FAA imposed altitude restriction of 1000-1500 ft due to their danger to aircraft and the inability of the operators to react quickly enough to avoid full scale aircraft.  In contrast, a UAV mounted system can spiral up to 3000 ft in a relatively short time period, yielding high quality weather measurements and can quickly be diverted to avoid full scale aircraft which enter into the area of UAV flights.</p><p>

<b>Type of Drone:</b> VIPAR (Vertical Integrated Patrol And Reconnaissance)</p><p><b>Status:</b> Disapproved</p><p>
<b>General Location of Drone Activity:</b> Ogden, UT</p><p>
<b>Stated objective/purpose of COA:</b> Ogden City Police seeks nocturnal surveillance of potential high-crime areas of Ogden, UT.  Pursuant to this, Ogden Police has partnered with the Utah Center for Aeronautical Innovation and Design (UCAID) at Weber State University to design and supply a lighter-than-air vehicle to be known as VIPAR (Vertical Integrated Patrol And Reconnaissance), which will be equipped with low-light camera(s) and used to patrol a limited area of the city at night time.  

Operation of the Ogden Police Department UAS is in Class G airspace at or below 400 feet AGL.  Some of the airspace Ogden Police intends to fly within is Class D airspace during daytime when KOGD control tower is in operation; however the airspace downgrades to Class G at nighttime, the time when the airship will be flying. The operation will launch/recover to/from a department of public safety building in Ogden.  Flights are expected to take place nightly between 00:00 and 05:00 local.  Flights will take place only in VFR conditions.</p><p>
<b>Effective Dates:</b> Not effective as of 9/8/2011 (application disapproved)</p><p>
<b>Comments:</b> Police wanted to use a blimp drone to conduct surveillance over high-crime areas for five hours at night. FAA disapproved the application.</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/ogden-police-department-utah" target="_blank">https://www.eff.org/document/ogden-police-department-utah</a></p>

							<value>Ogden City Police seeks nocturnal surveillance of potential high-crime areas of Ogden, UT.  Pursuant to this, Ogden Police has partnered with the Utah Center for Aeronautical Innovation and Design (UCAID) at Weber State University to design and supply a lighter-than-air vehicle to be known as VIPAR (Vertical Integrated Patrol And Reconnaissance), which will be equipped with low-light camera(s) and used to patrol a limited area of the city at night time.  

Operation of the Ogden Police Department UAS is in Class G airspace at or below 400 feet AGL.  Some of the airspace Ogden Police intends to fly within is Class D airspace during daytime when KOGD control tower is in operation; however the airspace downgrades to Class G at nighttime, the time when the airship will be flying. The operation will launch/recover to/from a department of public safety building in Ogden.  Flights are expected to take place nightly between 00:00 and 05:00 local.  Flights will take place only in VFR conditions.</value>
