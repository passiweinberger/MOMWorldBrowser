					<name>ECHELON - Joint Defense Facility at Pine Gap</name>
					<open>1</open>
					<description><![CDATA[<p style="width:300px">Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia<br /><br />
Pine Gap is the commonly used name for a satellite tracking station at 23.799°S 133.737°E, some 18 kilometres (11 mi) south-west of the town of Alice Springs in the centre of Australia which is operated by both Australia and the United States. The facility has become a key part of the local economy.<br /><br />
It consists of a large computer complex with eight radomes protecting antennas and has over 800 employees. It is officially called the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap since 1988, previously it was known as Joint Defence Space Research Facility.[2] It is believed to be one of the largest ECHELON ground stations and appears to be physically and operationally similar to the American signals intelligence facilities at Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado and Menwith Hill, United Kingdom. United States government personnel at Pine Gap are believed to be mostly from the National Security Agency and subordinate service-associated agencies as well as the Central Intelligence Agency.<br /><br />
As published in ERSA by CASA the airspace around Pine Gap is the only area in Australia designated as "prohibited" which prohibits entering and overflying the airspace up to a height of Flight Level 180 (approximately 18,000 ft or 5,500 m).<br />Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Gap" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> <br /><br />

The Shoal Bay Receiving Station east of Darwin is one part of the Naval Communications Station. The second part, the Humpty Doo Transmit Station, is located 60 kms south of Darwin. It has two primary roles: the interception of satellite communications and the interception of high frequency signals. In 2005 the station housed a total of 17 antennas. As Australia's principal source for interception of Indonesian military and civilian communications, Shoal Bay has had a particularly role in Australian government understanding of Indonesian military activities in East Timor from 1975 to 1999, an understanding usually withheld from the Australian public. In 2005, 85 personnel worked at the station, made up of Navy, Air Force, and Army staff, as well as Defence civilians and contractors. Boeing Australia is the largest contractor, with 45 staff associated with the site.

Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert is the most northerly, permanently inhabited location in the world, located only 817 kilometres from the geographic North Pole.<br /><br />
On April 1, 2009, the Air Force took command of CFS Alert. It is now a unit of 8 Wing Trenton, Ont.<br /><br />
The station was first settled in the early 1950s as a weather station of the Joint Arctic Weather Station (JAWS) System. On Sept. 1, 1958, Alert began its operational role as a signals intelligence unit of the Canadian Forces. At that time, it became the Alert Wireless Station and was under the command of the Canadian Army.

The New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau operates what it describes as a radio communications interception facility at Tangimoana, 30 kilometres west of Palmerston North, in New Zealand.<br /><br />
According to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the facility is part of ECHELON, the worldwide network of signals interception facilities run by the UKUSA (UK-USA Security Agreement) consortium of intelligence agencies (which shares global electronic and signals intelligence among the Intelligence agencies of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and NZ); its role in this capacity was first identified publicly by peace researcher Owen Wilkes in 1984. and investigated in detail by peace activist and independent journalist Nicky Hager.<br /><br />
The Tangimoana station is a sister operation to a similar facility run at Waihopai.  Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSB_Tangimoana" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> <br /><br />

					<description><![CDATA[<p style="width:300px">Ayios Nikolaos, Cyprus, United Kingdom<br /><br />
The Lincolnshire Poacher is the nickname of a mysterious, powerful shortwave numbers station that uses two bars from the English folk song "The Lincolnshire Poacher" as an interval signal. The station is believed to be operated by the British Secret Intelligence Service. It consists of an electronically-synthesised English-accented female voice reading groups of 5 numbers: e.g. '3-9-7-1-5', etc. Curiously, the final number in each group is spoken with a lifted voice. It is likely that the station is used to communicate to undercover agents operating in other countries (known as illegals), to be decoded using a one-time pad.

The site was first developed by the Naval Research Laboratory in the early 1960s as the site of a 600 ft (180 m) radio telescope that would gather intelligence on Soviet radar and radio signals reflected from the moon and would gather radioastronomical data on outer space, but the project was halted in 1962 before the telescope construction was completed. The site was then developed as a radio receiving station. The site was activated as "Naval Radio Station Sugar Grove" on May 10, 1969, and two Wullenweber Circulary Disposed Antenna Arrays (CDAAs) were completed on November 8, 1969. Numerous other antennas, dishes, domes, and other facilities were constructed in the following years. Some of the more significant radio telescopes on site are a 60 ft (18 m) dish (oldest telescope on site), a 105 ft (32 m) dish featuring a special waveguide receiver and a 150 ft (46 m) dish (largest telescope on site).<br /><br />
The site is part of the ECHELON communications network operated by the United States and its allies to intercept and process electronic telecommunications. The network operates many sites around the world including Waihopai Valley in New Zealand, Menwith Hill in the United Kingdom and Yakima, Washington.<br /><br />  Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Grove,_West_Virginia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> <br /><br />

The Shadow Factory: The Ultra-Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America<br /><br />
In northern Georgia near the South Carolina border, a few miles from Leburda's Grits N' Gravy and the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, one of the most secret facilities in the world is undergoing a major expansion. When completed, it will likely be the largest eavesdropping facility every created, employing more than four thousand civilian and military "voice interceptors" and other specialists. Run by the ultra-secret National Security Agency, it is where the agency eavesdrops on the Middle East and Northern Africa, thousands of miles away. Inside, behind barbed-wire fences, heavily armed guards, and cipher-locked doors, earphone-clad men and women secretly listen in as al-Qaeda members chat on cell phones along the Afghan border, and to insurgents planning attacks in Iraq. The also target and record American citizens in that region, including businesspeople, journalists, and Red Cross workers, as they engage in intimate conversations with their spouses back home and discuss confidential matters and business deals. "A lot of the time you could tell they were calling their families," said one of the NSA intercept operators who listened in on Americans, "incredibly initimate, personal conversations . . . Basically all rules were thrown out the window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on Americans."

748th MI Battalion<br /><br />
Relocated, redesignated, deactivated, reactivated, resubordinated...and now integrated and automated.<br /><br />
A lot has happened in the last 54 years. Originally activated in 1942 as Monitor Station One at Vint Hill Farms Station, Warrenton, Va., the 748th MI Battalion, 702d MI Group, INSCOM, stands as an example of ‘change to meet the Army’s needs.’ One of its first changes was a relocation to Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. Another change was its redesignation as the U.S. Army Security Agency Field Station San Antonio with two companies.<br /><br />
At that time, the unit became part of the Consolidated Security Operations (now the Medina Regional SIGINT Operations Center) which was jointly manned by the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force. It was (and still is) located at the Medina Annex of Lackland Air Force Base. The unit was redesignated the U.S. Army Field Station San Antonio in May 1980.<br /><br />
Company B evolved into Headquarters and Headquarters Company. Company A deactivated on Jan. 10, 1983, then reactivated on Oct. 14, 1987. Company B was reactivated on Oct. 6, 1993. On Jan 1, 1988, the unit was redesignated the 748th MI Battalion. The 749th Military Intelligence Company, Key West, Fla., was subordinated to the battalion on June 1, 1988. The 749th MI Company was later deactivated July 8, 1993.<br /><br />

The National Security Agency, the nation's cryptology branch, has leased the former Sony chip plant in Northwestern Bexar County and plans to hire at least 1,500 employees, NSA officials said Thursday. Even more jobs could be added as the site develops in several phases, according to the NSA. Nationwide, the NSA is hiring up to 4,500 employees through 2008 and some of those employees will be located here, according to an e-mail message from Ellen Cioccio, an NSA spokeswoman. The NSA already has about 2,000 people at Lackland AFB's Medina Annex. In addition, a group of experienced analysts will transfer from NSA's Fort Meade, Md., headquarters to San Antonio. They will be here to train the military and new civilian employees, Cioccio said.<br /><br />
The San Antonio NSA office includes personnel from the Army, Marine Corps., Navy, Air Force and the civilian Defense Department. "NSA is expanding its presence in San Antonio as part of our transformation efforts and as a result of the lessons learned from our global war on terrorism experiences," according to Cioccio. San Antonio beat out sites in Georgia and Hawaii for the NSA expansion project. San Antonio was chosen because the NSA already has a large, growing presence here.<br /><br />
The new NSA site, at Loop 410 and Military Drive, consists of two connected buildings that contain office and research and development space totaling about 475,000 square feet. Those buildings could be expanded by several thousand more square feet. In addition, Office Properties Trust plans to buy 43 more acres around the 50-acre Sony Campus. The campus has the ability to accommodate three more buildings and its developers eventually expect the site to exceed 1 million square feet, making it the city's second largest office park after USAA's headquarters on the North Side. The developers need to do some remodeling to the site to accommodate the NSA operations, which are expected to begin moving in this fall.<br /><br />
Already, San Antonio has a strong presence of cyber security operations and research with existing NSA operations and the U.S. Air Force Intelligence Agency at Lackland, nicknamed Security Hill. The University of Texas at San Antonio also is one of 59 universities in the nation recognized by the NSA, which designated it a center for academic excellence in information assurance education. With its growing expertise, San Antonio has developed a reputation nationwide as a top-notch information security city, said U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez. And since 9-11 and Gulf War II, the U.S. government has been beefing up its intelligence agencies and particularly its operations here, he said.<br /><br />
The Texas Congressional delegation received a briefing on the NSA expansion in San Antonio on Thursday. The project has been kept top secret because of its mission. "It's a sophisticated operation in every way," Gonzalez said. "This is a great opportunity for individuals in San Antonio." The site will be a major intelligence campus of the NSA and one of the largest campuses outside of Fort Meade, where the NSA has between 20,000 and 30,000 employees and operates like a small city. The NSA must expand outside of Washington because they've run out of room at their current site, Bamford said. The San Antonio site will also help diversify the agency and not make them as vulnerable in the event of an attack, he said. On May 4, the NSA will have a career fair at the Omni Hotel in San Antonio. The agency is looking to hire intelligence analysts, language experts, computer scientists, mathematicians, signals analysts, accountants, financial analysts, investigators and police officers.
